 ARMOUR_TITLE_TANK_SCHOOL:0 "$own_tank_school_tech$\n-->"
 own_tank_school_tech:0 "Our Own Tank School"
 own_tank_school_tech_desc:0 "Our industry allows us to develop and produce tanks ourselves, since we can no longer be satisfied with just buying armored vehicles from abroad."
 own_tank_school_tech_tt:0 "§YIt is impossible to produce any tanks without learning this technology.§!\n§RThis technology is not available for research and requires any tank school from §HOfficer Corps§!.§!"
 increasing_mobility_of_equipment_tech:0 "Increase Tanks Mobility"
 increasing_mobility_of_equipment_tech_desc:0 "The tanks of the Great War were very slow and slow-moving machines that were easy to hit with artillery. Decades later, with the development of aviation, it is clear that the «if you want to live, you should be able to spin» or better «you should be able to fast move» principle is very important for armored vehicles."
 adhere_to_mass_standards_tech:0 "Compliance with Standards of Mass"
 adhere_to_mass_standards_tech_desc:0 "We must keep track of the mass of armored vehicles, since most bridges simply may not be able to withstand the movement of too heavy tanks over them, and in addition, to transport them over long distances we will have to use special railway platforms or very powerful trucks."
 increase_engine_power_tech:0 "Increase Engine Power"
 increase_engine_power_tech_desc:0 "To increase the speed of tanks you need to increase the power of their engines. However, this race is clearly not in favor of the latter. In addition to the task of increasing mobility, the tasks of increasing the artillery and armor of tanks have emerged in parallel, which also force an increase in the size and weight of the vehicles."
 increase_motor_life_of_equipment_tech:0 "Increase Engine Life of Vehicles"
 increase_motor_life_of_equipment_tech_desc:0 "Installing engines on tanks has caused them to fail fairly quickly. Tank engines work most often at the wear and tear and the limit of their power, which leads to very rapid breakdowns, not typical for conventional vehicles. This factor makes it difficult to repair and advance tank units in combat conditions."
 using_existing_engines_tech:0 "Using Existing Engines"
 using_existing_engines_tech_desc:0 "Engines are the most frequently released and required «part» of a tank, but also one of the most complex, consisting itself of hundreds of individual parts. This makes it necessary to increase their production by all available methods, including adapting more common automobile engines to tanks."
 special_tank_engines_tech:0 "Special Tank Engines"
 special_tank_engines_tech_desc:0 "Automotive engines can never achieve the performance required for installation on tanks, so we must engage in the design of special engines designed strictly for military purposes."
 narrow_specialization_of_machines_tech:0 "Narrow Specialization of Machines"
 narrow_specialization_of_machines_tech_desc:0 "We must not concentrate on one or two types of tanks, for by creating a wide range of armored vehicles-from light reconnaissance tanks to sophisticated flamethrower and engineer tanks-we can be most effective in the battlefield."
 multitasking_tanks_tech:0 "Multitasking Tanks"
 multitasking_tanks_tech_desc:0 "By spreading our forces too thinly across multiple models of armored vehicles, we inflate transportation and logistics costs. Better to focus on producing a small set of basic tanks that will perform various combat missions, thus cheapening their cost."
 attention_to_ergonomics_tech:0 "Attention to Ergonomics"
 attention_to_ergonomics_tech_desc:0 "The first tanks were not known for good conditions for the crew - the carbon monoxide smoke inside the fighting compartment and the rumble prevented tankers from fighting most effectively. In addition, staying inside these armored monsters for long periods of time was dangerous and difficult. We must continue to improve tank ergonomics so the crew can fully concentrate on their combat missions."
 complication_for_good_tech:0 "Complication for Good"
 complication_for_good_tech_desc:0 "Tanks are too expensive to lose in large numbers - our goal is to maximize the combat effectiveness of each individual armored unit by providing the crew with the greatest choice of tools for combat."
 
 struggle_for_survivability_of_crew_tech:0 "Crew Survivability Measures"
 struggle_for_survivability_of_crew_tech_desc:0 "A tank is a rather complex combat mechanism, which requires at least several months for crew training. Besides, we don't have so many people to sacrifice them unnecessarily. Because of that, we have to take care of maximum survivability of the tankers."
 reducing_size_of_tanks_tech:0 "Reduce the Size of Tanks"
 reducing_size_of_tanks_tech_desc:0 "By making a tank small enough, we can solve several problems at once: reduce its detectability on the battlefield, make it easier to transport, and allow it to operate in places where larger vehicles will not physically reach."
 simplification_of_tank_design_tech:0 "Simplify of Tanks Design"
 simplification_of_tank_design_tech_desc:0 "It is not necessary to engage in unnecessary complication of tank designs, because in combat in any case the equipment will be rather quickly disabled. Our task is to increase the production of tanks in quantities sufficient for their massive use on wide sections of the front."
 increase_of_internal_space_tech:0 "Increase the Interior Space"
 increase_of_internal_space_tech_desc:0 "Tanks should be large enough; this will make it easier for the crew to work in it, improve their interaction with each other, and make it harder for the enemy to defeat them. It will also allow for larger guns and powerful engines."
 inclined_armor_tech:0 "$sloped_armor$"
 inclined_armor_tech_desc:0 "To increase armor resistance of tanks it is not necessary to do it by increasing thickness of armor plates - it is enough to place them at a sufficient angle to the horizontal, so that a shell already needs to pierce a larger layer of metal."
 anti_discharge_booking_tech:0 "Anti-shell Armor"
 anti_discharge_booking_tech_desc:0 "Recent successful experiences with tanks in combat have led military experts to the conclusion that modern ways of protecting the crew certainly keep them safe from infantry action, but the minimal means of artillery and other modern anti-tanking methods ruin the ability of tanks to inflict tangible damage on the enemy."
 separation_of_crew_and_ammunition_tech:0 "Separation of Crew and Ammunition Stowage"
 separation_of_crew_and_ammunition_tech_desc:0 "One obvious way to keep the crew alive is to isolate them from the explosive elements of their own tank's ammunition, which can cause an internal explosion when an enemy shell penetrates the tank."
 insulation_of_fuel_tanks_tech:0 "Isolation of Fuel Tanks"
 insulation_of_fuel_tanks_tech_desc:0 "The next dangerous element to the crew is engine fuel, which is often common gasoline, which is a light explosive substance."
 separation_of_fuel_tanks_and_ammunition_tech:0 "Separation of Fuel Tanks and Ammunition"
 separation_of_fuel_tanks_and_ammunition_tech_desc:0 "When isolating the crew from the explosive elements of the tank, we must remember that it is better not to place the shells themselves near the fuel as well, since this mixture can create an explosion of such force that the crew will die anyway. It will also increase the time for the crew to fight fires."
 combating_radiation_contamination_tech:0 "Anti-radiation Protection"
 combating_radiation_contamination_tech_desc:0 "The weapons of mass destruction created by mankind make it questionable to use other types of equipment after it, since even tank crews are not protected from the radiation that penetrates through armor. We must find ways to combat it so that we can safely throw armored formations into combat after an enemy or our own nuclear strike."
 front_engine_location_tech:0 "Front-engine Layout"
 front_engine_location_tech_desc:0 "A fairly simple but effective way to protect the tank crew could be to change the layout of the vehicles - by placing the engine at the front of the hull and the crew behind it, we would provide additional protection for the men, although the tanks' ability to evade fire would suffer."
 
 concept_of_self_propelled_guns_tech:0 "Concept of Self-propelled Artillery"
 concept_of_self_propelled_guns_tech_desc:0 "Experiments in motorization and mechanization of artillery have been conducted in various countries since the end of the Great War, but so far no one has taken it seriously. If we are the first, we will have an advantage over other nations' armies on the battlefield"
 bet_on_artillery_tanks_tech:0 "Bet on artillery tanks"
 bet_on_artillery_tanks_tech_desc:0 "Self-propelled guns are a rather silly idea - in fact, to make ordinary tanks without any trouble, besides being poorly protected. It would be much more effective to use artillery tanks in our army - standard vehicles rearmed with more powerful guns to fight infantry and enemy fortification"
 
 freedom_for_designers_tech:0 "Freedom for Tank Designers"
 freedom_for_designers_tech_desc:0 "By allowing our tank designers to engage in their own experimental research, we can, in a little while, have the most advanced examples of armored vehicles unparalleled in the world."
 courage_in_layout_of_armored_vehicles_tech:0 "Experiments in the Layout of Tanks"
 courage_in_layout_of_armored_vehicles_tech_desc:0 "The first tanks are strikingly different from those now common in all the armies of the world. This thought tells us that progress in the layout of armored vehicles does not stand still, which means we should not be afraid to give freedom to designers in this matter and then at the most important moment they will find the necessary solution, and the army will get the most modern examples of armored vehicles."
 unique_guns_tech:0 "Unique Guns"
 unique_guns_tech_desc:0 "We should take a closer look at some of the less common weapons and apply them to our armored vehicles, as they have high combat potential."
 swinging_tower_tech:0 "Oscillating Turret"
 swinging_tower_tech_desc:0 "Unlike the traditional turret design, which is a one-piece rotating structure in which the gun for pointing in the vertical plane is placed in a movable installation on trunnions passing through the embrasure, the swinging turret consists of two parts - a rotating lower and a oscillating relative to it upper, in which the gun is placed. The main advantage of a swinging turret over conventional turrets is the immobility of the gun relative to the top of the turret, which makes it possible to use the simplest possible loading mechanism."
 non_standard_suspensions_tech:0 "Нестандартные подвески" #не используется
 non_standard_suspensions_tech_desc:0 "" #и ты тоже
 
 work_on_technical_task_tech:0 "Work According to the Terms of Reference"
 work_on_technical_task_tech_desc:0 "We need to formulate clear tasks for designers who will then quickly complete them without wasting their energy on unnecessary useless work. Then we'll cut the time from when a machine is needed to when it appears on the battlefield."
 standardization_of_models_tech:0 "Standardization of Models"
 standardization_of_models_tech_desc:0 "Tanks consist of many small components, which complicates both their production and operation, and even their repair. Therefore, we should strive to reduce all this nomenclature by unifying some parts."
 solving_logistics_problems_tech:0 "Logistical Problem"
 solving_logistics_problems_tech_desc:0 "To simplify repair and ongoing maintenance of armored parts we should strive to use a narrow range of fuels and a small range of ammunition."
 
 increased_firepower_tech:0 "Increase Firepower"
 increased_firepower_tech_desc:0 "Perhaps the main thing we should do when creating armored vehicles is to improve their firepower: the number and power of their barrels, the use of additional means of fire: machine guns, flamethrowers, and so on."
 increase_number_of_trunks_tech:0 "Increase the Number of Barrels"
 increase_number_of_trunks_tech_desc:0 "To increase the density of fire, tanks should be armed with multiple guns. This will allow them to deal a large amount of damage in a minimum amount of time in important combat situations."
 combined_artillery_systems_tech:0 "Special Unified Gun Carriages"
 combined_artillery_systems_tech_desc:0 "Since the multi-tower concept is gradually becoming obsolete on vehicles, we need to simplify the installation of guns in a single turret by developing special single gun carriages for them."
 one_gun_for_all_problems_tech:0 "One Gun for All"
 one_gun_for_all_problems_tech_desc:0 "Using multiple guns on tanks results in an expanded ammo inventory as well as increased tank size, so we should focus on using only one gun that will be capable of performing all necessary tasks."
 using_autocannons_tech:0 "Autocannons"
 using_autocannons_tech_desc:0 "Autocannons allow you to increase the density of fire, which is important for reconnaissance tasks of light tanks, as well as in the case of fighting against enemy manpower. And if enemy tanks don't have enough armor, autocannons become ideal anti-tank weapons."
 automatic_charging_systems_tech:0 "Autoloader"
 automatic_charging_systems_tech_desc:0 "Manual charging of guns limits the ability to increase the caliber of the gun, in addition, the speed of tanks becomes dependent on the physical abilities of the loaders. This issue can be solved by using automatic charging systems, but so far designers have only been puzzled by this issue and cannot completely get rid of the loader position in tanks."
 drum_charging_systems_tech:0 "Drum Machine"
 drum_charging_systems_tech_desc:0 "The first and easiest way to almost automatically load a gun is the drum system. In the aft turret unit two horizontal drums with six cells for a unitary shell in each were arranged. The energy of the cannon's recoil provided the operation of the automatic loading system. When the barrel was moved, special mechanisms made the drums rotate to bring a new projectile to the line and send the ammunition to the breech. After the shot was fired, the cartridge case was ejected automatically."
