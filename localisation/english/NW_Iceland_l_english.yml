 NW_ICE.0.t: "Current Political Situation"
 NW_ICE.0.desc: "The history of modern Iceland began in 1918 when Iceland was declared a sovereign state in personal union with Denmark. Defense and foreign policy remained under Danish control.\n\nIceland's prosperity after the Great War ended with the onset of the Great Depression, which severely affected the export of cod, the backbone of the Icelandic economy. Against this backdrop, in 1934, a coalition of the Progressive Party, supported by the rural areas, and the Social Democratic People's Party, representing the cities, formed the so-called 'workers' government' led by the energetic Hermann Jónasson.\n\nCurrently, the ruling coalition's position is relatively strong. The Independence Party, despite its high popularity, cannot compete with the alliance of the two parties, and the position of the communists is too weak. However, the Prime Minister needs to pursue a prudent policy to maintain power and prevent a coalition split."
 NW_ICE.0.a: "Jónasson's cabinet will lead the country to prosperity!"
 NW_ICE.1.t: "Negotiations on the Merger of the People's Party and the Communist Party"
 NW_ICE.1.desc: "Despite the fact that the Communist Party emerged as a result of a split in the Social Democratic People's Party in 1930, there is currently some improvement in relations between the parties. In this context, the communists have initiated negotiations for a merger with the social democrats.\n\nHowever, the leading leaders of the People's Party, while not impeding the negotiations, view them with extreme mistrust, considering them another ploy by the Communist Party. For example, the desire of the communists to obtain any guarantees that the social democrats will not abuse their majority in the new party, the leadership of the People's Party interprets as the communists seeking veto power within the party. Thus, the merger of the parties remains unlikely.\n\nNevertheless, the Communist Party continues to actively advocate for the merger, while urging its supporters to vote for the People's Party in districts where the communists themselves have little influence. This tactic has had a significant impact on many social democrats. In the event that members of the People's Party feel marginalized within the coalition with the Progressive Party, some social democrats may decide to create a united party with the communists after all."
 NW_ICE.1.a: "To maintain the coalition's power, we must prevent a split in the People's Party."
 NW_ICE.2.t: "Electoral System of Iceland"
 NW_ICE.2.desc: "Iceland's electoral system is quite complex. In particular, elections to the Althing (parliament) are held in single- or two-member constituencies by majority vote, except in Reykjavik, where four seats are elected by proportional representation. However, this system implies that a party that secures a slight majority in a two-member constituency takes both seats in parliament from that region. Despite the presence of 'compensatory' seats, some constituencies remain overrepresented.\n\nThis situation is extremely advantageous for the Progressive Party, which, despite receiving 22% of the votes in the 1934 elections, won the same number of seats in the parliament's Upper House as the Independence Party, which was supported by 42% of the voters. However, there is increasing pressure on the government to change the procedure for parliamentary elections. Although the ruling coalition would still have a chance to remain in power even with an electoral system reform, the People's Party may find it disadvantageous to maintain the alliance with the Progressive Party, and Jónasson will be forced to resign."
 NW_ICE.2.a: "The electoral system will not be changed."
 NW_ICE.2.b: "We will yield to the pressure of the opposition."
 NW_ICE.3.t: "Nationalists' March"
 NW_ICE.3.desc: "The nationalist party, whose members adhere to the Icelandic version of fascism, has always been characterized by a high degree of militarism. This was once again confirmed when nationalists organized several marching squads on May 1st, parading through the streets of Reykjavik with the Icelandic flag adorned with a swastika. Party members were dressed in gray shirts and wore armbands decorated with a red swastika.\n\nThis event caught the attention of the majority of the capital's residents, but despite the widespread admiration for Hitler in Iceland, the popularity of the Nationalist Party remains quite low. However, in the face of persistent fear of growing communist sentiments, we can use the nationalism of the nationalists to our advantage."
 NW_ICE.3.a: "Icelanders of all social classes, unite!"
 NW_ICE.4.t: "Trade Unions of the North"
 NW_ICE.4.desc: "The trade unions of the north of the country, including the city of Akureyri, which is considered the northern capital of Iceland, have long been the main stronghold of communist influence on the island.\n\nLately, the People's Party has pursued an active policy aimed at regaining its influence among the workers of the north. Active campaigning, the exclusion of particularly radical and unrestrained communists from some trade unions, and the reorganization and creation of new trade unions have allowed the social democrats to achieve some success.\n\nHowever, many workers still see communists as their main defenders of their rights. Social democrats expect that unofficial assistance from local authorities, controlled by the Progressive Party, can help them unite the northern trade unions under their leadership. As coalition partners, we must support the People's Party."
 NW_ICE.4.a: "We will provide unofficial support."
 NW_ICE.4.b: "We should not interfere."
 NW_ICE.5.t: "Publication of the Minister of Finance's Diary"
 NW_ICE.5.desc: "Sensational news has spread across the island today. Representatives of the Nationalist Party were able to obtain a copy of the Minister of Finance's diary and published it in their newspaper, 'Island.' The police conducted searches in party offices and arrested several leading members of the NP. The incident has attracted wide public attention, and the government needs to determine its next course of action."
 NW_ICE.5.a: "We will refrain from issuing indictments."
 NW_ICE.5.b: "The guilty will be punished."
 NW_ICE.6.t: "Decline in Cod Exports"
 NW_ICE.6.desc: "Spain has long been one of the main importers of Icelandic salted fish. However, the ongoing civil war in that country has led to a sharp decline in our exports."
 NW_ICE.6.a: "This is a major blow to our small economy."
 NW_ICE.7.t: "The Question of Social Security"
 NW_ICE.7.desc: "Since coming to power, the 'Working Class Government' led by Hermann Jónasson, consisting of the Progressive and People's Parties, has implemented extensive social reforms. Comprehensive social security legislation has been introduced, and the Poor Relief Act has been improved. However, the lack of significant success in addressing the crisis affecting Iceland may compel the government to reconsider its policies.\n\nReducing certain social obligations will help the state more effectively combat the crisis, but the People's Party, whose electorate consists mainly of urban residents, especially workers, will oppose such a decision. Representatives of the Progressive Party may leverage their dominant position in the government to push through a decision contrary to the opinion of the social democrats. Previously, we blocked the People's Party's initiative to introduce unemployment benefits, which was a huge shock to the social democrats."
 NW_ICE.7.a: "The working class government must live up to its name."
 NW_ICE.7.b: "We should reduce social expenditures."
 NW_ICE.8.t: "Migration Policy"
 NW_ICE.8.desc: "The issue of migration is quite acute in our society. Many residents of Iceland believe that, given the country's low population, the arrival of a significant number of immigrants could negatively impact the national identity of Icelanders.\n\nThe Prime Minister Jónasson holds a similar opinion and is a supporter of the purity of the 'Icelandic Aryan race.' However, the backward Icelandic economy needs skilled professionals and qualified workers. Perhaps the government should soften its migration policy, especially concerning Jewish refugees seeking to leave Germany. However, in this case, some voters may turn away from the ruling coalition and support the Nationalist Party, which has an extremely strict stance on the migration issue."
 NW_ICE.8.a: "The migration policy will not be changed."
 NW_ICE.8.b: "We should soften the migration policy."
 NW_ICE.9.t: "The Fate of Kveldulfur"
 NW_ICE.9.desc: "Today, heated debates erupted in the Althing regarding the fate of Kveldulfur, the country's largest fishing company, which is also owned by Olafur Thor, the chairman of the Independence Party. Some members of parliament proposed declaring the company bankrupt, as it has long been unable to meet its debt obligations. However, their opponents argue that the bankruptcy of one of the largest employers in the country would have a negative impact on the economic and social situation."
 NW_ICE.9.a: "The Progressive Party will block this initiative."
 NW_ICE.9.b: "Kveldulfur will be declared bankrupt."
 NW_ICE.10.t: "Strengthening Kveldulfur"
 NW_ICE.10.desc: "The decision not to declare Kveldulfur bankrupt has proven to be justified. In a little over a year, the company has significantly improved its debt situation and remained in the market."
 NW_ICE.10.a: "Great news."
 NW_ICE.11.t: "Desecration of Medieval Burial Sites"            #Tjorsardalur, Greifswald#
 NW_ICE.11.desc: "Recently, it has come to light that a group of nationalists conducted unlawful excavations at medieval graveyards in the Thjorsardalur Valley. None of the participants had any legitimate grounds for such "investigations," let alone the authority to plunder the earthly remains of ancient Icelanders.\n\nApproximately 30-35 skeletons were excavated, with their skulls likely taken out of the country, presumably for anthropological research at the Greifswald Institute of Anthropology."
 NW_ICE.11.a: "Such actions are inhumane and reprehensible."
 NW_ICE.12.t: "Split in the People's Party"
 NW_ICE.12.desc: "The People's Party has always been relatively heterogeneous. Lately, there have been increasing disagreements among its members regarding the party's future, as well as growing dissatisfaction with the coalition with the Progressive Party. Against this backdrop, the left wing of the People's Party broke away and, after brief negotiations, merged with the Communist Party.\n\nAs a result of this merger, the "Party of People's Unity - Socialist Party" was created. Although its program, which calls for establishing a socialist system in Iceland "based on national-historical and social foundations" and represents a compromise between left socialists and communists, is relatively moderate, many Icelandic politicians have once again expressed fear of a left-wing takeover.\n\nAt the same time, the dwindling People's Party still maintains its commitment to the ruling coalition. However, this situation may change after the elections in April 1937."
 NW_ICE.12.a: "This is a disaster!"
 NW_ICE.13.t: "Surge in Popularity of Nationalists"					  #Gutto-fight#
 NW_ICE.13.desc: "Both the Progressive Party and the Independence Party have always had many nationalist-minded politicians who sympathized with fascist regimes in Europe. Against the backdrop of the strengthening communist movement, an increasing number of supporters from traditional parties have started leaning towards the more resolute Nationalist Party. The right-wing fears a repeat of the 1921 scenario, when workers in Gúttó clashed successfully with the Reykjavik police."
 NW_ICE.13.a: "The situation is becoming tense."
 NW_ICE.14.t: "Natan Friedman's Guard"
 NW_ICE.14.desc: "In 1921, during his attendance at the Comintern Congress in Russia, the communist Ólafur Friðriksson encountered a young orphan named Natan Friedman and brought him back to Iceland. Natan suffered from an eye condition, which raised concerns among the authorities about its potential contagiousness, sparking intense debates. Although it was later determined that this fear was unfounded, the government still chose to deport the boy. Some time later, when labor unrest erupted in Iceland, the communist militia led by  Ólafur took on the name of Natan Friedman.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of mounting tension in the country and a rise in confrontations with nationalists, the communists have once again established the Natan Friedman's Guard. While Iceland has seen its share of militarized organizations, this particular development undoubtedly adds to the growing unease."
 NW_ICE.14.a: "This time, the police will be able to maintain order."
 NW_ICE.14.b: "It is necessary to gain the support of nationalist groups."
 NW_ICE.15.t: "Clashes on the Streets"
 NW_ICE.15.desc: "Recently, during political demonstrations, clashes between communists and nationalists have become increasingly frequent. The confrontations mostly occur without the use of weapons, but there have been instances where people were hospitalized with stab or gunshot wounds.\n\nThe Icelandic National Police strives to contain the unrest, but it's a challenging task. We can give the order to focus on containing the communists, whom the government considers more dangerous, or continue to contain both factions."
 NW_ICE.15.a: "The communists are more dangerous."
 NW_ICE.15.b: "We will maintain our previous strategy."
 NW_ICE.16.t: "Elections in Althing"
 NW_ICE.16.desc: "Today, the latest parliamentary elections in the Althingi have concluded. According to the results of the popular vote, the Progressive Party gained four new seats, even though the number of votes for them only increased by 3%. The People's Party lost two seats, despite a decrease in the number of votes by only 2.8%.\n\nThe working-class government remains in power, but the People's Party's position within it has significantly weakened. Against this backdrop, an increasing number of people have started to voice their concerns about the fairness of the current electoral system. However, the ruling coalition still received more votes than the Independence Party, and the government continues to represent the interests of the majority."
 NW_ICE.16.a: "The elections of 1942 may prove problematic..."
 NW_ICE.17.t: "Elections in Althing"
 NW_ICE.17.desc: "he first elections in Althing after the recent electoral system reform have concluded today. The Independence Party emerged as the largest party in parliament. Although the IP and PP still hold a slight advantage in seats, the Social Democrats allied with the Independence Party and formed a new coalition."
 NW_ICE.17.a: "This is the end of Jonasson's rule."
 NW_ICE.18.t: "Elections in Althing"
 NW_ICE.18.desc: "The 1937 elections in Althing were held in a very tumultuous atmosphere. Against the backdrop of indecisive policies from traditional parties, nationalists became the largest faction in parliament, allowing them to form the government. This was also facilitated by a significant faction defecting from the Independence Party to join them.\n\nAlthough the police pledged allegiance to the new government, it will take time before the nationalists can overcome the resistance from left-wing forces who still harbor hopes of coming to power or at least preserving the democratic regime."
 NW_ICE.18.a: "The beginning of a new era in the country's history."
 NW_ICE.19.t: "Elections in Althing"
 NW_ICE.19.desc: "The 1937 elections in Althing were held in a very tumultuous atmosphere. Despite resistance from right-wing forces, the Party of People's Unity managed to become the largest faction in parliament. Amid police disarray, Nathan Friedman's Guard emerged as the most combat-ready force in the country.\n\nThe communists hastily proclaimed the overthrow of the monarch and the establishment of a republic."
 NW_ICE.19.a: "The beginning of a new era in the country's history."
 NW_ICE.20.t: "Government Reshuffle"
 NW_ICE.20.desc: "Today, it was announced that there have been changes in the government. Skuli Gudmundsson from the Progressive Party has taken the position of Minister of Employment, replacing his People's Party counterpart. Now, the government consists solely of representatives from the Progressive Party."
 NW_ICE.20.a: "Interesting news."
 NW_ICE.21.t: "Formation of the People's Unity Party"													#Hedinn Valdimarsson#
 NW_ICE.21.desc: "Although most members of the People's Party were skeptical about the idea of merging with the Communists, Hedinn Valdimarsson, against the party's statutes, continued negotiations and was subsequently excluded from the People's Party. As a result, he and his supporters eventually formed an alliance with the Communists, leading to the creation of the People's Unity Party - the Socialist Party, whose program is based on the aspiration to establish a socialist system in Iceland 'on a national-historical and social basis.'"
 NW_ICE.21.a: "And yet the split could have been much larger."
 NW_ICE.22.t: "National Government"
 NW_ICE.22.desc: "Today, it was officially announced that a national government, involving all three major parties, has been formed due to increasing tensions in the world."
 NW_ICE.22.a: "Together we will endure these times."
 NW_ICE.23.t: "Resignation of Jónasson"
 NW_ICE.23.desc: "Amid growing dissatisfaction with the current political system and increasing disagreements within the government, the 'Government of the Working Class' began to crack. The final straw was the question of introducing a bill on wage and price arbitration. The Minister of Social Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Chairman of the People's Party, who disagreed with the law's implementation, demanded his removal from all government positions. This effectively led to the collapse of the cabinet of ministers. Hermann Jónasson made a deal with Ólafur Thors not to change the electoral districts and resigned. As a result, a government consisting solely of the Independence Party was formed."
 NW_ICE.23.a: "And yet his rule was commendable."
 NW_ICE_DEN.0.t: "Loss of Contact with Iceland"
 NW_ICE_DEN.0.desc: "Against the backdrop of the chaos caused by Germany's sudden attack on our country, communication with Iceland was lost. The Icelandic Althing, as during the First World War, temporarily assumed full power in the country. However, if our army withstands the German onslaught, overcoming the chaos of the first days of war, we will be able to restore communication with Iceland after some time."
 NW_ICE_DEN.0.a: "Let's hope it's temporary"
 NW_ICE.24.t: "Loss of Contact with Denmark"
 NW_ICE.24.desc: "Against the backdrop of the chaos caused by Germany's sudden attack on Denmark, communication with the metropolis was lost. The Icelandic Althing, as during the First World War, temporarily assumed full power in the country. If the Danes manage to hold on, overcoming the chaos of the first days of war, communication will be restored. However, current events may serve as a good reason for the final declaration of independence."
 NW_ICE.24.a: "Let's keep an eye on the situation"
 NW_ICE.25.t: "Communication Restored"
 NW_ICE.25.desc: "After several days, communication between Iceland and Denmark was restored. The Danes now expect that the authority of Christian X in our country will be reinstated."
 NW_ICE.25.a: "Finally, the situation has stabilized."
 NW_ICE.25.b: "We will not go back."
 NW_ICE_DEN.1.t: "Iceland Refuses to Submit"
 NW_ICE_DEN.1.desc: "Although we managed to restore communication with Iceland, its government has refused to once again submit to Christian X, hoping that in the current situation, we will have other priorities than Iceland, especially considering that many of our politicians are sympathetic to the idea of the island's independence."
 NW_ICE_DEN.1.a: "Express a diplomatic protest."
 NW_ICE_DEN.1.b: "We cannot turn a blind eye to illegal actions."
 NW_ICE_ENG.0.t: "Operation Fork"
 NW_ICE_ENG.0.desc: "Iceland represents a crucial strategic foothold, providing control over the entire North and Central Atlantic. In the current situation, [ENG.GetName] cannot do without bases on the island. However, the Icelandic government insists firmly on its neutrality.\n\n[ENG.GetLeader] asserts that if an attempt is made to further negotiate with the Icelandic government, the Germans may become aware of it and act preemptively. A more reliable and efficient solution would be to conduct a surprise troop landing and present the Icelandic government with a fait accompli."
 NW_ICE_ENG.0.a: "This is a sound decision."
 NW_ICE_ENG.0.b: "We have more pressing issues."
 NW_ICE_ENG.1.a: "British Invasion"
 NW_ICE_ENG.1.desc: "We have received information that [ENG.GetName] is preparing to occupy Iceland to prevent its capture by Germany. Iceland will have to maintain self-governance, but our neutrality will be compromised."
 NW_ICE_ENG.1.a: "We will not resist."
 NW_ICE_ENG.1.b: "We will not relinquish our independence without a fight."
 NW_ICE_DEN.2.t: "Iceland Displaces Christian X"
 NW_ICE_DEN.2.desc: "The Icelandic Althing, citing Christian X's failure to fulfill his constitutional duties on the island, has decided to replace him with a regent. This measure is presented as temporary, but effectively makes Iceland an independent state."
 NW_ICE_DEN.2.a: "We can't do anything."
 NW_ICE_DEN.2.b: "We cannot allow the treaty of the union to be violated with impunity."
 NW_ICE_WORLD.0.t: "Iceland Declares Itself a Republic"
 NW_ICE_WORLD.0.desc: "Although Iceland has enjoyed de facto independence for some time now, having replaced Danish King Christian X with a regent, it is only now that the Icelandic government has decided to definitively sever the union with the Danish dynasty and abolish the monarchy. The first president of the republic appointed by the Althing is Sveinn Björnsson, the former regent of Iceland."
 NW_ICE_WORLD.0.a: "Long live the republic!"
 NW_ICE_WORLD.0.b: "Another monarchy has fallen."
 NW_ICE.26.t: "Beer Day"
 NW_ICE.26.desc: "Today, Icelanders celebrate Beer Day, which marks the anniversary of the complete repeal of the prohibition on alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn the 1908 referendum, Icelanders voted to ban all alcoholic drinks. However, in 1921, the ban was partially lifted after Spain refused to buy Icelandic fish unless Iceland purchased Spanish wines. Later, in a national referendum, the population voted to legalize alcoholic beverages. However, strong spirits were not included in the vote to appease the anti-alcohol lobby.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, Icelandic conservative officials were hesitant to lift the ban, and it was only when socialists came to power that the government decided to lift the prohibition on beer and other beverages considered strong."
 NW_ICE.26.a: "A toast to the Chairman of the Central Committee!"
