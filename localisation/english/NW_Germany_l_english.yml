    GER_principle_of_liberal_interventionism_desc: "Even before the National Socialists came to power, Gördeler had strongly supported the deflationary policies of Heinrich Brüning's government, advocating austerity measures and a fundamental reorganisation of the social security system, which in his view should be made more 'organic', proportionate to the 'potential of the economy', subject to the principle of greater 'individual responsibility' and placed in the hands of trade unions. In doing so, as «Reichskommissar for Price Supervision», he saw his main task as stimulating the mechanisms of the market economy precisely through state intervention. This principle of «liberal interventionism» overlapped with the politician's conviction that «life is struggle ... and that also prices should be formed in accordance with the natural laws of struggle to ensure a comparatively high standard of living for everyone and generally to create the best conditions for production»."

    GER_reorganization_of_tax_and_financial_legislation_desc: "The Great Depression exposed the shortcomings of the German economy. The politicians of the Weimar Republic tried to correct them at its demise, but failed, and the Nazis who came to power implemented policies which were fundamentally different to their political programme, and moreover not only did not correct the problems, but rather bought them off, hiding them behind countless secret schemes and deceptions. Therefore, reforms in both the financial and fiscal sectors of the law are needed to correct them."
    GER_responsible_complicity: "Responsible Complicity"
    GER_responsible_complicity_desc: "Gördöller realised that economic education of the people had in itself a socially integrating function and could serve as a means against fragmentation and class struggle. The justified intention of economic education was to 'overcome the circle of mistrust and suspicion on the part of wage earners and encourage them to show tolerance and leniency', which in a broader political context would mean: through education 'to restore recognition in relation to the economic and social order'. In this tactical approach to the 'instrumental' use of economic education one can trace the idea that in the process of learning 'natural laws' the workers should acquire the skills of 'responsible complicity' in the economic life of the enterprise, to teach them to subordinate their individual interest to the need to solve general economic problems and to better understand the significance of the strict economic, financial and sociopolitical programmes implemented by the government. Gördeler also has no doubt that spreading economic knowledge to workers can have a positive impact on their work efficiency."

    GER_strengthening_role_of_economic_chambers: "Strengthen the Role of Economic Chambers"
    GER_strengthening_role_of_economic_chambers_desc: "Gördeler's conservatism lies in the attempt to limit the influence of political parties on the public life of the country - something he saw both under the Empire and in the Republic. In order to do this he believes that the second chamber of parliament should be handed over to associations of people by profession so that they too can directly influence the passing of laws, balancing the dominance of the parties."

    ###
    NWgermany.1.t: "The Fate of Telman"
    NWgermany.1.desc: "The former head of the German Communist Party, Ernst Thalmann, has been held in prison in Berlin for several months. He was arrested a couple of days before the last Reichstag elections. Initially it was planned to bring Telman to trial for high treason. For this purpose, the intelligence services began to collect materials that were to prove the preparation of the KPD for the putsch. However, because of the great legal problems in trying to prove this information, and in order to avoid a failure like in the Leipzig trial for setting fire to the Reichstag, during 1935 we decided to abstain from judicial decision.\n\nNovember 1, 1935 the Second Senate of the People's Court revoked the preliminary detention (without stopping the proceedings in a court case as such) and simultaneously handed Telman over to the Gestapo for «protective custody». At this point, the international protest movement against Telman's imprisonment had reached its climax. World figures sympathetic to the Communists are writing letters in support of him and asking that he be released from custody. Perhaps we should go along with them, so as not to irritate other governments."
    NWgermany.1.a: "We should just kick him out of the country"
    NWgermany.1.b: "We won't make concessions"
    
    NWgermany.2.t: "The Split in the Party"
    NWgermany.2.desc: "From the beginning the Nazi Party had two wings: a right wing and a left wing. There was a long struggle between them, culminating in the events of the «Night of the Long Knives», when the main leaders of the Socialist faction of the NSDAP and the SA Stormtroopers command were murdered. However, one important functionary of the party, Otto Strasser, the younger brother of Gregor Strasser, the leader of the Left, managed to survive. While he was in Prague last year, he announced the formation of an «alternative German government» to which many opposition politicians and dissidents began to join, not only from the NSDAP, but also from other parties: the DNVP, KPD, SPD.\n\nOne important issue on which the two factions differed was the attitude to the Reichswehr. The leaders of the Left proposed abolishing the old army and replacing it with a «people's army» de facto legalizing the SA Stormtroopers. This caused great apprehension on the part of the Reichswehr generals, who demanded that Hitler choose between them and his party comrades.\n\nThen he trusted the military and chose in their favor - but now they betrayed Hitler and this in turn damaged the trust in him of the part of the NSDAP that oscillated between the two main factions. Today this split has become clear, as Strasser has moved his government from Prague to the southeast of the country and some NSDAP officials and politicians have sworn him in."
    NWgermany.2.a: "We are not interested in other kinds of Nazism"
    NWgermany.2.b: "We will join this movement"
    
    NWgermany.3.t: "People's Front Rebellion"
    NWgermany.3.desc: "After the NSDAP came to power and the remaining left-wing parties were banned in Germany, they not only emigrated to other countries, but also engaged in underground activities which, by the time our confrontation with Hitler began, had not been finally suppressed. Taking advantage of the moment of disintegration of the state apparatus because of the civil war, they decided to raise their own rebellion."

    NWgermany.4.desc: "Despite the unified monarchical dynasty, several descendants of the last Kaiser at the moment wish to take his throne. However, Wilhelm II himself, currently in exile in the Netherlands, would not refuse the throne offered to him.\n\nShould be understood that each of the contenders have different political views and ambitions, and most importantly - different reputations in society. Old Wilhelm, though supported by the old Prussian aristocracy and the higher generals, is extremely unpopular because of his defeat in the Great War. His son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, has similar views to his father, but is not stained by his reputation as a defeatist, even though he collaborated with the Nazis. The Kaiser's grandson, Wilhelm of Prussia, is a new generation, and will have no claim to a greater role in the future state."

Old Wilhelm, though supported by the old Prussian aristocracy and the higher generals, is extremely unpopular because of his defeat in the Great War.

The Kaiser's grandson, Wilhelm of Prussia, is a man of a new generation, and he will not claim a major role in the future state. However, the best contender is Oskar, the younger son of Wilhelm II, who was a member of the Steel Helm organization in the 1920s and has good friendships with the new Chancellor Carl Goerdeler."

However, he would like to clarify whether he can maintain his position in the country by submitting to Germany in foreign policy."

    NWgermany.10.desc: "Since most of our success in the civil war was made by Germany in the form of arms and finances from the SS, we will now have to pay the price by submitting to Germany in the area of foreign policy."

    NWgermany.11.t: "Use of Slave Labor"
    NWgermany.11.desc: "Having conquered vast areas in eastern Europe, we have gained under our control a huge number of civilians who can be used as virtually free labor in our factories. If we replace German workers with them, we can thus free up more manpower for use in the army.\n\nAlternative use of slave labor could be to supplement existing factories, expanding our production capabilities, but we would need to dedicate some of our armed forces to control them."
    NWgermany.11.a: "We will replace workers with slaves"
    NWgermany.11.b: "Expand our industries"
    
    NWgermany.12.t: "Negotiations with Germany"
    NWgermany.12.desc: "German diplomats after the National Socialist Party came to power in their country began constantly storming our missions with proposals for some kind of agreement between our two countries, whether military, political alliances, or simply a non-aggression pact. And while an alliance with Germany is out of the question, the idea of a non-aggression pact between Germany and the British Empire looks attractive enough.\n\nHowever, we should realize that by signing such an agreement we would immediately disturb the peace order in Europe and leave France alone in its confrontation with Germany. But should we again die for the interests of other powers, while in the Far East the Empire of Japan raises its head, long desiring to seize our colonies."

    NWgermany.13.desc: "Our diplomats succeeded in persuading the British government to conclude a non-aggression pact with us-now our interests in continental Europe would not be threatened by France's alliance with the British Empire.

    NWgermany.14.t: "Britain's Refuse of the Pact"
    NWgermany.14.desc: "Despite long attempts by our diplomacy to establish an understanding with the British government, they still did not agree to negotiate a non-aggression pact with us, which would have benefited both our side in taking control of European politics and Britain in freeing up forces to confront the growing appetites of the Japanese Empire in the Far East."

Thanks to the purges in our party, quite a number of people have already joined him, who expect to occupy government positions in the event of the overthrow of our government. One of the fighters of the Black Front was this Jew, Hirsch, who was to carry out an attack on the NSDAP headquarters using two suitcases with explosives, which he had received from abroad on the train.

    NWgermany.33.t: "A Military Coup"
    NWgermany.33.desc: "Adolf Hitler's National Socialist regime nearly drove Germany into another suicidal war with the countries of Western Europe. After the Fuhrer gave the order to resist French troops trying to restore the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland, the Wehrmacht command decided to mount a coup against the NSDAP. Hitler and his inner circle were killed during the seizure of the Reich Chancellery building, in all parts of the country the military took over. However, it was impossible to deal with the Nazis so easily - the ideologically loyal SS units and some soldiers disobeyed the army ranks and began to put up scattered resistance in all parts of the country."

However, they did not stop trying to destroy the republic and replace it with a monarchy or other authoritarian regime. Because of this, they supported our party in seizing power in the country. But in doing so, they clearly expected that they would get their share of power, or at least maintain their semi-independent position.Moreover, the current military command stands on a purely defensive policy and opposes any idea of offensive wars.\n\nNaturally, this goes completely against the policy of the National Socialist Party.  But thanks to the actions of our secret services, we have obtained compromising information on the heads of the army - Field Marshal General Werner von Blomberg and Commander-in-Chief of the Land Forces Werner von Fritsch. Blomberg had recently married a girl who had been a prostitute in her twenties, much to the officer's reputation, and Fritsch was generally suspected of sodomy-one of the Berlin tramps agreed to testify against him."

After Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, the so-called Potsdam Day was held - the opening of the first session of the Reichstag at which Hermann Goering announced «victory over the Weimar» and the end of the «years of want and disgrace» under the Republic. All the sons of Wilhelm II as well as representatives of the SA, SS, Hitlerjugend, Steel Helm, Reichswehr and police were present at this solemn event. This day was a symbol of the transition of power from the elderly President Hindenburg to the Nazis and Hitler, who succeeded Friedrich II and Bismarck.\n\nSome members of the imperial family hoped to get their share of the action as well - a restoration of the monarchy at least along the lines of Italy under Mussolini. However, there were too many haters of the Hohenzollerns and opponents of the restoration in our party who thought they had already fulfilled their role.\n\nNow that we have rid ourselves of the influence of these radicals and find ourselves in a situation with a tarnished reputation ourselves, it is worth recalling these plans and suggesting that one of Wilhelm II's heirs take the throne."

    NWgermany.49.t: "The Real German Revolution"
    NWgermany.49.desc: "Ernst Niekisch gave his first speech to ordinary Germans and the few media survivors of the civil war. He informed them of the mistakes of his predecessor, Otto Strasser, and the loss of the revolutionary fervor necessary for the further struggle for the existence of the German nation and the liberation of the oppressed strata of society. For this purpose he wants to implement the doctrine of National-Bolshevism in the country. Instead of Strasser's organization, he decided to create the German National-Bolshevik Party, or GNBP for short, which he headed."

    NWgermany.50.desc: "The German Civil War ended with the victory of the leftist splinter of the NSDAP led by Otto Strasser. He promoted the idea of a broad anti-Hitler front, thanks to which many figures of the left-wing movement, from the Social Democrats to the Communists to the National Bolsheviks, joined him. The leader of the latter, Ernst Niekisch, managed to raise his ideas among the soldiers of the People's Army and the political elites of the Strasser government. As a result, soon after winning the civil war, Strasser was overthrown by his own subordinates, making Nikisch the new Führer.\n\nOne of his main ideas was to develop cooperation with our state, for the sake of joint opposition to the Western bourgeois world, calling this concept the «community of destiny». Now these statements are taking real forms - German diplomats are suggesting that we consider a project of political alliance between Germany and the USSR."

    NWgermany.55.desc: "-Of course, if we regard, as I and my friends do, Hitler's system as a necessary stage of transition from a decaying old order to a developing new one, as an epoch when outmoded forms will be swept away-then we shall have the joyful conviction that such an epoch of destruction cannot be long-lasting. From this point of view, Hitler is nothing more than a test «hammer of God» used to pound on people and things to see whether they still have life, whether they still have faith, will, strength, and the power to renew themselves. Where these good qualities are lacking, the hammer destroys old forms to powder-just as in Scripture a tree that does not bear fruit is to be mercilessly cut down. But when fruiting is still possible, the will and power to renew will inevitably arise after the severe test of these blows; under new forms, but in the old spirit, the spirit of the «Mother» according to Faust, which dwells in the depths of our soul, the soul of every man, the soul of every nation, the soul of the West. Revolutionary in form, conservative in essence, is a policy that follows from such a consideration... Victory over Hitler and his destructive system, victory in this war over the forces of destruction, is no less certain than the advent of Hitler and this war. Both derive from the necessity and nature of the «German Revolution»!\n\nOtto Strasser's speech at the first rally to celebrate the victory of the Civil War lasted a few more minutes."

After World War I, the victorious powers proclaimed the principle of the self-determination of peoples, but this principle was applied very selectively: For example, the Austrians who, immediately after the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy, expressed their desire to be part of Germany did not get this opportunity. In addition, a huge number of Germans remained in Czechoslovakia, living in the Sudetenland. We have to decide how this question will be resolved: by military pressure on these states, or by making an appeal to the League of Nations to resolve this question."

However, Otto Strasser himself doubts the humanity of such ideas and their attractiveness, so he considers it necessary not only to stop any persecution of the Jews, but also to recognize them as part of the German nation.

    NWgermany.78.desc: "Chancellor Goerdeler led Germany through a difficult period of reform and reconstruction after the Nazi regime. He managed to implement most of the reforms he conceived: the economy was rebuilt according to his classical liberal views, while the political sphere reflected his conservative side - the parties were severely limited in their power, and the state system is best described by the term «authoritarian democracy». This is due to the imprint that the period of the Weimar Republic and its party diversity had on Germany.\n\nNow the country faces the task of regaining its own international standing, but Gördeler had doubts about his professionalism in international politics, causing him to think of resigning as chancellor, laying down a good political tradition."
    NWgermany.78.a: "It is during this difficult period that Gördeler should continue to run the country"

    NWgermany.79.desc: "Before resigning, Gördeler should nominate his heir. Close in spirit and plans for international politics might be Major General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck a promoter of colonial policy and a nationally known hero of the Great War - he would be best able to lead Germany through the millstones of foreign policy. Another could be Franz von Papen, a constant behind-the-scenes schemer who is good at negotiating between politicians within the state and with leaders of other countries. And a third candidate could be Theodor Duesterberg, who gained Gördeler's trust during the reform period, the former head of the «Steel Helmet», also known to the masses and even a candidate for president during the Weimar Republic."

Three main candidates have been put forward in the debate: Lettow-Vorbeck, as Gördeler himself wanted, but two others: the media magnate Alfred Hugenberg, whom Hitler beat out in the race for the chancellorship, and the «Lord of War» and ideologist of German fascism, Waldemar Pabst, who has developed many international connections over the years of his political activity."
    NWgermany.80.a: "For Hugenberg this is the last chance to become chancellor"

    NWgermany.81.desc: "Germany, despite the change of government, has decided to continue the old Nazi course of refuse the Versailles obligations. It is worth noting that this foreign policy course has many supporters not only at home, but also among politicians in other countries who believe that Germany was indeed undeservedly wronged after the Great War.

    NWgermany.82.desc: "After defeat in the Great War, Germany lost its small colonies in Africa and Oceania. Some of these, located in Africa, were given to our state under mandated administration. This ruthless policy toward the defeated enemy, of which we warned diplomats during the Paris Peace Conference, led to a revanchism among Germans and a rise in the popularity of political radicals. In order to throw them off, Germany had to fall into the millstone of the civil war. But the government that came to power did not abandon the foreign policy ambitions of its predecessors and demanded that at least part of Germany's African colonies be returned to their country."

This despite the fact that our soldiers had shed blood capturing it on the battlefields of that war. However, in all likelihood we will have to give this piece of territory back to Germany, and plans for a fifth province will have to be abandoned."

Southwest Africa was once again a German colonial possession, as it had been before 1914 when the British Empire invaded.

    NWgermany.98.desc: "We have received a telegram from Ribbentrop addressed to our Foreign Minister — Comrade. Molotov.\n\n«We definitely expect to finally defeat the Polish army within a few weeks. Then we will keep under military control the territory that was defined in Moscow as the sphere of German interests. Naturally, however, we will be forced for military reasons to continue fighting against those Polish armed forces that will be at that moment on Polish territory belonging to the sphere of Russian interests. Russian Russian forces, please discuss this with Molotov immediately and find out whether the Soviet Union does not consider it desirable that the Russian armed forces act at the appropriate moment against the Polish armed forces in the area of the sphere of Russian interests and, for their part, occupy this territory. In our opinion, this would not only be a relief for us, but would also correspond to the spirit of the Moscow agreements and Soviet interests...»"

We have already prepared a statement regarding our offensive against Poland:\n\n«..the Polish state has collapsed and no longer exists, therefore all agreements concluded with Poland are being canceled;\nthe third powers may try to benefit from the chaos that has arisen;\nthe Soviet Union considers it its duty to intervene to protect its Ukrainian and Belarusian brothers and allow this unfortunate population to work quietly.»"

    NWgermany_CW.1.t: "Wehrmacht Expulsion Takes Heavy Toll on [wehrmacht_state_withdrawn.GetName] Region"
    NWgermany_CW.1.desc: "Finally [wehrmacht_state_withdrawn.GetName] is under our control, but the battle has been harsh. The Wehrmacht became more and more desperate with each advance we made, sometimes fighting until only ruins remained around them. They often pursued scorched earth tactics, guided by the so-called «Beck's Decree».\n\nUntil we end this war, further destruction is to be expected."
    
    NWgermany_CW.2.t: "Strasserists Expulsion Takes Heavy Toll on [strasserist_state_withdrawn.GetName] Region"
    NWgermany_CW.2.desc: "Finally [strasserist_state_withdrawn.GetName] is under our control, but the battle was harsh. What seemed to be a colossus on clay feet, Strasser's People's Army proved to be an extremely motivated formation that led the battle to the very end. For this reason, the devastation left in the wake of the battles proved to be extremely powerful.\n\nThis war becomes more and more devastating for the country."
    NWgermany_CW.2.a: "It's time to end it"
    
    NWgermany_CW.3.t: "Communists Expulsion Takes Heavy Toll on [communist_state_withdrawn.GetName] Region"
    NWgermany_CW.3.desc: "After a long time, [communist_state_withdrawn.GetName] is back under our control. The Communists fought to the last man they could get to stand with a rifle. In addition, many structures in the cities were destroyed by them in order to prevent our further advance. Their guerrilla strategy keeps us on our toes.\n\nThe sooner we end the war, the better for the future of the country."

    NWgermany_CW.4.desc: "Unthinkable news is coming from around the region [current_target_fraternization_state.GetName]!\nField officers and journalists report an unsanctioned cease-fire on the vast front line. The soldiers look exhausted and tired from the prolonged fratricidal war. Many of them can't stand it and refuse to shoot their fellow soldiers."
