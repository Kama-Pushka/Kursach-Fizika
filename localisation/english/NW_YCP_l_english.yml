     YCP_zhao_dong_desc: "One of the youngest anti-Japanese heroes, born in 1912 in Liaoning, wanted to pursue science and was able to enter the physics department of Northeastern University in 1931, but the Japanese invasion radically changed his life. He became involved in the student anti-Japanese movement, joining the famous Miao Kexiu and becoming his closest deputy. Both of them joined the Chinese Youth Party, which at that time was gaining popularity in the north of the country. Thanks to the support of the Party leadership, they managed to create their own resistance army, which successfully fought guerrilla battles with Japanese troops in southern Manchukuo. However, in mid-1935 Miao was killed and all leadership responsibilities fell on the shoulders of 23-year-old Zhao. He is also the third son of Zhao's famous "Grandma Two Guns" Hong Wenguo, a Manchu woman from the Aixin Gyoro clan, who is herself an active organizer of resistance to the Japanese in the northeast."

     ycp.1.a: "Welcome"
     
     ycp.2.t: "Greetings from the Young Marshal"
     ycp.2.desc: "The young Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang, once the ruler of the whole of Manchuria, who was expelled from there by the Japanese troops, but who wants to take revenge on them, has recently established in Xi'an the Northeast National Salvation Association, through which he organizes support for various anti-Japanese movements. In Beijing, from his representative, we were able to obtain some financial and military aid through this association. Although the Young Marshal had once banned Young Chinese propaganda in his army, he still allowed Wen Zhaoyuan, a renowned commander of the Chinese Youth Party, to lead one of his divisions."
     ycp.2.a: "Thank you so much for remembering us"
     
     ycp.3.t: "Emergency Meeting"
     ycp.3.desc: "Despite the seeming successes of our army in the war with the Japanese: the proclamation of our own government and the recruitment of new soldiers, the situation is beginning to deteriorate every day. We are experiencing very severe armament problems. To solve this problem, Zhao Dong had a plan to go to his mother in Beijing for help, so that from there he could organize supplies to the army with her help. In his place, Bai Junshi, his deputy, will temporarily lead the army. However, he is not sure of the correctness of this decision - to abandon the army at such a crucial moment."

     ycp.5.t: "Zhao Dong's Arrival"
     ycp.5.desc: "Zhao Dong, a legendary guerrilla fighter from the northeast, arrived in our capital. He led one of the armies that the Chinese Youth Party leaders created thanks to the active students of the north and northeast. These troops fought a stubborn guerrilla resistance against the Japanese invaders for several years. Zhao returned to us with only a few dozen men, all that remained of his troops. His reputation was so famous that he was immediately in the lens of journalists who interviewed him extensively. He was also officially promoted to the rank of general of the ROCAF"
     ycp.5.a: "Thanks for being alive!"
     
     ycp.6.t: "Zhao Dong's Death"
     ycp.6.desc: "Zhao Dong went on his next journey to the territory occupied by the enemy to organize there another guerrilla army, but he could not reach his goal - he was despicably killed apparently by Communist agents or their soldiers in neutral territories of China. The CPC denies its involvement in his death, and it is difficult to find direct evidence of his death in the conditions of war, but the agents of our special services declare with full confidence that his death is in the hands of the Communists."
     ycp.6.a: "What bastards they are"
     
     ycp.7.t: "The Return of Zhao Dong"
     ycp.7.desc: "Zhao Dong returned to the army's location with the finances, weapons, and fresh blood drawn from Beijing and North China. On such an event, a small parade was organized, led by Zhao himself, carrying the banner of our army. After the parade, there was also an impromptu rally where Zhao gave a speech that raised the morale of the army. Although it is worth noting that his return itself \"opened the second breath\" of our soldiers."
     ycp.7.a: "We'll liberate the northeast!"

     ycp.8.desc: "The Iron Blood Army continues to resist the Japanese attempts to subjugate Manchuria completely. Their successes are astonishing to many Chinese throughout the country, but their movement is constantly on the verge of survival. Now the territories under their control are close to ours, and they themselves have sent their negotiator to us, who proposes that we come over to their side and incorporate our administration and troops into the Iron Blood Army. This will instantly restore our reputation and rid us of the stigma of \"traitor\" that has arisen since the proclamation of the East Hebei government."

This could greatly change the situation in the Northeast in favor of the anti-Japanese forces."

     ycp.11.desc: "Amazing news came from northeastern China - Chinese troops managed to liberate Manchuria from the Japanese invaders and their puppet armies. And it was done by semi-guerrilla formations independent of any of the current governments of the country. They call themselves the \"Iron Blood Army\", and their backbone was formed by associations of patriotic students from North China, especially from Beijing, who dropped out of school and went to war."

     ycp.12.desc: "In an unexpected way, a new force grew up in the arena of Chinese politics - the Chinese Youth Party, or Young Chinese. They emerged in the mid-1920s among Chinese graduates of foreign universities as a movement promoting genuine national revolution and Western-style democracy. However, for a long time they remained in the shadow of the two giants, the Kuomintang and the Communists, as they did not possess their own armed formations. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, they led the resistance to the invaders and managed to drive them out of their lands. They now proclaimed their own national government in Mukden."
     ycp.12.a: "The Japanese invasion changed China's political landscape in a radical way"
     ycp.12.b: "Interesting"
     ycp.12.c: "This is our once-in-a-lifetime chance"
     
     ycp.13.t: "Convening of the Provisional Parliament"
     ycp.13.desc: "As early as the party's program, published in October 1930, it was envisaged the beginning of \"nationwide rule\" by means of a bicameral parliament and a responsible government to eliminate the one-party dictatorship. Now at last this has been realized in reality.\n\nThe parliamentary elections were held according to a mixed scheme: some deputies are elected from constituencies and some from professional communities. The only amendment is that it will be a temporary parliament for the duration of the civil war, and since our government does not yet control most of the country's provinces, the elections were held only in the Northeast. The Chinese Youth Party won a majority, thanks to its popularity because of the liberation of that region from Japanese rule.\n\nWith control of other provinces, there will be by-elections for deputies, increasing the total number of parliamentarians."
     ycp.13.a: "Let's destroy party dictatorships!"
     
     ycp.14.t: "The Fate of the Party Conspirators"
     ycp.14.desc: "In 1932, during the VII Party Congress held in Beijing, a serious crisis occurred - a part of the Party's military youth, who had actively participated in the battles against the Japanese as part of the guerrilla armies, resisted attempts to establish contacts with the Kuomintang government and proposed to elect a new Party leader who would have sole authority to form the Party's central executive committee. After forceful threats on their part, on the advice of Li Juan, this group of the party was given the opportunity to take power. However, the failure of their resistance to the Japanese by 1935 and the flight of the new party leadership from Beijing to Hong Kong allowed the old leaders to regain power during the VIII Party Congress in 1935 in Shanghai.\n\nNow after the old leadership has proved its ability to organize resistance to the Japanese, it has an unqualified reputation as winners and it is possible that we should no longer fear any influence of this faction, but should invite them to participate in our new government movement, setting aside and forgetting the old quarrels between us."
     ycp.14.a: "We could use the extra hands"
     ycp.14.b: "They've proven to be ineffective"
     
     ycp.15.t: "Status of Drug Trafficking"
     ycp.15.desc: "Opium addiction and other drug trafficking is the scourge of China, which it still cannot cope with. In the 1920s, the drug trade became a very profitable business for warlords, as it was a good way to enrich their coffers. Then the Japanese rule of Manchuria made the situation even worse, despite the formal fight against opium by the Kuomintang. One of the first issues raised in the parliament when the constitution was drafted was the status of drugs."
     ycp.15.a: "Drug prohibition"
     ycp.15.b: "Let's abstain"
     
     ycp.16.t: "Status of Prostitution"
     ycp.16.desc: "Another, more invisible, but no less publicly trembling issue is the situation of women representatives of the \"oldest profession\". Because of the poor situation in many regions of the country, it is sometimes a way out of the difficult financial situation for women, but on the other hand, it only continues to corrupt the Chinese nation from within, especially if it is allowed at the official level. On the other hand, the experience of other countries shows that even a complete state ban on prostitution only diverts it to the black market, making prostitutes even more unprotected."
     ycp.16.a: "Let's ban prostitution"
     ycp.16.b: "Let's choose a hybrid scheme"
     ycp.16.c: "Let's authorize prostitution"
     
     ycp.17.t: "Republic's flag"
     ycp.17.desc: "The last important and controversial issue is which flag the republic should adopt - whether to retain the banner of the Chinese Youth Party under which the Northeast was liberated, or to revert to the five-color flag of the Beiyang Republic, which is a symbol of the union of the five races but remained tarnished by the warlords' period of rule. Even the Chinese Youth Party is split about evenly on the issue, let alone the rest of parliament."
     ycp.17.a: "Let's keep the party banner"
     ycp.17.b: "Back to the flag of the five nations"
     
     ycp.18.t: "State Socialism Party"
     ycp.18.desc: "The main opposition party in parliament is the State Socialism Party, led by its leader Zhang Junmai. He is a prominent modern Chinese philosopher, intellectual and important politician. However, for a long time he was not involved in politics until the Japanese invaded the Northeast, which forced him to become actively involved in public life. Then he formed his own party, which was joined by several other prominent Chinese scholars and educators. Because of this \"professional connection\" the Young Chinese and Zhang's party had contacts since their founding, and because of its ideological, more leftist orientation, the State Socialism Party was able to form an excellent internal parliamentary opposition to the northeastern government, controlling the activities of the Chinese Youth Party itself."
     ycp.18.a: "We have learned to compete not with weapons, but with words!"
     
     ycp.19.t: "New Democratic China"
     ycp.19.desc: "In Beijing, celebrations were held to mark the establishment of civil peace in the country - the troops of the democratic government of the northeast have managed to establish their control over all corners of China, ending the bloodbath that lasted more than 30 years. The capital has been returned to its historical place, and the first real elections of the country's leadership should be held soon, as promised by the leaders of the Young China movement."
     ycp.19.a: "Is it really over?"
     
     ycp.20.t: "A Tale with a Sad Ending"
     ycp.20.desc: "- You see... We all thought that if we said the right words, did the right things and, finally, were sincere in our thoughts.... Then everything would work out, everything would be built, Chen Qitian looked sadly at the table between him and the journalist, It turned out not to be so. Even 'putting all the cards right', we lost this battle. Something else is probably needed to fully modernize China. Saying that China is not ready for democracy seemed like some kind of enemy propaganda. The miracle that we succeeded in Manchuria gave everyone such enthusiasm that, on its inertia, everyone believed in the ability to implement Western-style democracy in our country, to protect people's rights. But in this movement, the movement of spreading the democratic system to the south, in the rush of feelings, we did not notice how corruption and bureaucratization penetrated both our party and our government.... In fact, I think that somewhere this \"giddiness of success\" prevented us, clouded our minds, and mistakes were made.\n- To defeat a dragon, you have to become a dragon. - laconically noted the journalist.\n- An extremely pessimistic thought.\n\nFrom the window of the building came the louder and louder of some cheerful song. It was the approaching parade of troops and the cheers of the townspeople who accompanied them. The street euphoria burst into the room. Chen stood up and walked to the window. Without lowering his head, he stared slightly haughtily at the passing procession:\n- Yes, we won. But what was the cost?"

     ycp.21.desc: "- Today we can confidently declare that we have not only ended the civil war, but we have ended it with a nationwide victory of democracy in the whole country! - pronounced [ROOT.GetLeader] from the podium of a rally in Beijing to celebrate the final and irrevocable unification of the country by the northeastern democratic government led by the Chinese Youth Party. Their plan to gradually establish a full-fledged liberal constitutional government in China has been fully justified - in addition to the fact that their national government behaved legally and did not turn into another usurper of power, they have also managed to squeeze out the former elites at the local level, establishing locally legitimate elected government. Moreover, the first full-fledged national presidential elections are to be held in the near future, in which the Young Chinese have worthy competitors, formed during the period of being in official opposition to their government."
     ycp.21.a: "Is it a new wave of democratization in the world?"
     
     ycp.22.t: "The War is over"
     ycp.22.desc: "At the residence of [ROOT.GetLeader] the highest leaders of the Chinese Youth Party have gathered. Behind the doors of this residence they are victors and triumphants. They have driven out the Japanese. They have created a true third force in the country and challenged other corrupt governments, while being mostly ordinary scholars or teachers. They became the true embodiment of the country's small middle class. They defeated all party dictatorships, even those with support from abroad like the Communists.\n\nHowever, they themselves understand one important thing - full-fledged democracy has not been established, the country is on the brink. No, of course the civil war is over, the warlords have been eliminated, the resistance of other governments has stopped. But in the course of this confrontation too many concessions were made and some mistakes were made.\n\nThe gathering was divided into two camps: some believe that now it is impossible to \"let the country go on a free democratic voyage\", and therefore the Young Chinese should fight for the presidency in the upcoming elections. Others believe the opposite - it is by \"leaving power\" intentionally, skipping at least one electoral stage, that the party will allow other forces to come to power and learn to govern the country, testing the workability of the established system. The decisive vote remains with [ROOT.GetLeader]..."

Now they have formed their own government there and have become a third or rather fourth force in the civil war. Apparently they are preparing to fight the Kuomintang armies in the south and the Communists in the northwest, so our province is an important logistical point for them. They offer us a deal through their secret envoy - the defection of our province to their side in exchange for maintaining a small amount of autonomy."

Its leaders have been working with our provincial governors since the early 30s to clear the province of Communist troops.

Scattered detachments of Manchus flee to Korea, crossing the Yalu River, individual units of the Kwantung Army continue to lead an organized resistance.\n\nMany of our military officers warned of the excessive strengthening of the guerrilla movement in Manchuria and called for emergency measures. However, the Japanese government, which trusted the positive reports from Manchukuo, did not take decisive action, limiting itself to expanding material support for the Manchurian army. The fallacy of this reaction is now evident. The Chinese Youth Party, which had taken the major cities of Manchuria by a sudden underground attack, had raised an unprecedented wave of peasant revolt. In a few days it swept away the entire regional and city administration, and the Manchu soldiers called in to suppress the demonstrations cowardly deserted, not daring to shoot their relatives.\n\nJapan's shame will never be forgotten. But we need to mitigate the damage of this disaster."

Japan agrees to leave Manchuria and recognize the Chinese Youth Party in return for mutual security guarantees and the withdrawal of Japanese assets from the territories we have liberated.\n\nThere is no trust in the invader and our army is determined to fight to the end, but if we refuse, the negotiators warn us, a full-scale intervention by the Japanese army will follow, which will claim hundreds of thousands of lives and utterly destroy the Northeast. The bleeding Chinese Youth Party will not be able to hold on to its gains; we risk losing everything we have gained so hard."
