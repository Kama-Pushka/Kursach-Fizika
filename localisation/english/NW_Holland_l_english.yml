This will raise the less productive enterprises to the general level.

 HOL_creation_of_federations_in_Indonesia_desc: "We must create new federations in the territory of Indonesia that will help the cause of the workers in our former colony. However, before doing so, it is necessary to remove all colonial institutions there and introduce Esperanto."
 HOL_elimination_of_political_parties: "Elimination of Political Parties"
 HOL_elimination_of_political_parties_desc: "Sovietism - not just a defence of the worker's councils as organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, after the destruction of the old bourgeois state. It expresses a worker's vision that sees the existence of revolutionary political parties in the worker's councils as a negative factor. This negative conception of the revolutionary party comes from the fact that the worker's councils are the only crucible of revolutionary consciousness in the working class. According to Ruhle's "anti-authoritarian" conception, any party, even a revolutionary party, is bourgeois in nature and seeks to seize power from a group of intellectuals instead of the revolutionary proletariat, so we must eliminate and ban all political parties."
 HOL_newspaper_Radenkocommunism: "Newspaper «Retekommunism»"
 HOL_newspaper_Radenkocommunism_desc: "We must begin the active production of new newspapers. The theoretical review of our ideology will be issued in the newspaper "Retekommunism" and its agitation part will continue to be issued in the newspaper "Proletenstempmen". Our press must stand firmly on its internationalist principles, refusing to distinguish between the "democratic" and "fascist" camps. Retekommunism has proved that the unleashing of war is possible thanks to the "concentration of all capital in the hands of the state" and the "growing exploitation of the working class" in the country. This phenomenon is identical to the same in the "democratic" camp, which can create its own "totalitarian" capitalist organisation in a short period of time."
 HOL_introduction_of_Esperanto: "Introduction of Esperanto"

 HOL_united_International_with_Denmark: "United International with Denmark"
 HOL_united_International_with_Denmark_desc: "The Danish group of International Communists had been in existence since 1930, and even had a monthly magazine, "Marxist Worker's Politics". However, their group was extremely small, with only 12 members and links to the opposition within the Danish Communist Party. Its orientation was strictly Soviet, as it rejected any party. Its calls for "general strike" and "direct action" even reveals similarities with the anarchist current, somewhat distant from Soviet communism. We can establish links with them, and involve them in the creation of new federations within Denmark, after our revolution has swept over it."
 HOL_united_International_with_Hungary: "United International with Hungary"

 HOL_to_stop_the_intervention_of_the_bourgeois_revolution_desc: "Sovietism is the negative reaction of revolutionary groups to the experience of the Russian Revolution, which was rejected as a "bourgeois revolution" whose main social force was the peasantry and which could only end in state capitalism. The denial of the Russian Revolution led us to retrospectively identify Bolshevism in 1917 and Stalinism in 1927. Seeing nothing but final degeneration in the Russian Revolution, we must not allow other "worker's revolutions" led by one or more revolutionary parties substituting for the true power of the worker's councils."

There is no essential difference between Nazism and National Socialism, Social Democracy and Stalinism. The proletariat must wage a decisive struggle against the anti-fascist ideology, which, like fascism, is part of the active preparation of the world war.

The proletariat must wage a decisive struggle against anti-fascist ideology, which, like fascism, is part of the active preparation for world war.

He condemned folk schools, which would only adapt the worker to the easy activities necessary for industrial labour. While advocating a unitary school that should educate young people without distinction of sex, age, background or ability. "We demand a unity of education which includes all existing and reliable school institutions."

 HOL_transformation_into_a_federation_of_Soviets_desc: "Originally, our anarchist-syndicalist trade union was built on the social structure of a Soviet republic. Now, we must re-form our country into a federation of councils which will carry out three tasks: to indoctrinate the workers with the idea that they can build socialism only through their own efforts; to collect technical and economic data which can facilitate the labour of organising business; to awaken the workers to the irreconcilable class struggle in all its manifestations and in every place."

 NW_HOL.0.t: "January Anarchist Congress"
 NW_HOL.0.d: "The first news about the anarchists' activities this year has arrived. The Dutch Syndicalist Trade Union (NSV) has decided to toughen its anti-parliamentary position. The 'regardless of' clause has now also been officially dropped. This has been replaced by the following clause:\n\n-Members of parliamentary political parties are not allowed to remain members of the NSV;\n- Members of the NSV who carry out propaganda in violation of NSV principles must be expelled;\n\nOn the same conference, it became clear once again that people are not inclined to abandon anarcho-syndicalism. A proposal to focus propaganda primarily on the statement of NSV principles for the sake of better cooperation with anarchists was rejected. Albert de Jong, an opponent of this proposal, argued that it was never possible to build a strong militant workers' movement through the propaganda of only one principle.\n\nThe congress also raised the question of internal divisions over the change of leadership in the International Solidarity Fund, which was headed by Henk Eikeboom. The union objected to his appointment because of his poor financial performance in previous years."
 NW_HOL.0.a: "Such moves will only weaken their influence"
 NW_HOL.1.t: "German Refugees"
 NW_HOL.1.d: "The border between the Netherlands and Germany is separated by a water canal that is not deep and wide enough. As a result of this, refugees from Germany are fleeing to us, wishing to escape the punishment of the Nazi regime. Unfortunately, in addition to Jews and ordinary citizens, there were members of the German Communist Party in hiding, who will certainly strengthen the revolutionary views in our country by joining the Dutch Communist Party and internationalist communist groups."
 NW_HOL.1.a: "Their influence will be negligible"
 NW_HOL.1.b: "Send the police to round them up!"
 NW_HOL.2.t: "KPD Members Join the Ranks of the CPN and GIC"
 NW_HOL.2.d: "Communists who had fled Germany gradually joined the Communist Party and individual international groups adhering to the ideology of Rätecommunism. Not persecuted by the police forces, they greatly strengthened the theorists of these groups."
 NW_HOL.2.a: "That was a mistake."
 NW_HOL.3.t: "Search for KPD Members"
 NW_HOL.3.d: "The police have identified several houses in which refugees dangerous to us could be hiding. They used a cunning scheme by which they used false names and traveled from house to house without staying long, and if local revolutionaries met them in the street, they pretended not to know each other. When going around suspicious houses, every citizen refused to let the building be inspected without a warrant. Perhaps we should order suspicious homes to be searched without a warrant? Of course, this would cause resentment among citizens, but preparing warrants could take a long time, during which time refugees would leave their shelters."
 NW_HOL.3.a: "We cannot let them go!"
 NW_HOL.3.b: "We'll wait for the warrants"
 NW_HOL.4.t: "KPD Refugees Captured"
 NW_HOL.4.d: "Many disguised Communists have been found hiding in the homes of our citizens. All of them will be handed over to Germany, where they will be prosecuted by the local authorities. We are left with the choice of what to do with those individuals who have sheltered these criminals in spite of the prohibitions."
 NW_HOL.4.a: "Arrest them!"
 NW_HOL.4.b: "We were only concerned with the refugees"
 NW_GER_HOL.0.t: "The Netherlands Have Handed Over Members of the KPD"
 NW_GER_HOL.0.d: "The Dutch government has caught illegal refugees from our country's Communist Party and sent them back. Clearly, we must take them into custody immediately."
 NW_GER_HOL.0.a: "Great"
 NW_HOL.5.t: "KPD refugees Have Gone Hiding"
 NW_HOL.5.d: "Intimidated by the police investigations, the refugees left their houses before the police arrived, and the police only found the owners of their homes. It is obvious that members of the German Communist Party, frightened by such raids, will increase their vigilance and go even deeper into hiding. Of course, this is not the best option for us, but now we can be sure that we will not have to fear active action on their part."
 NW_HOL.5.a: "A sufficient solution for us"
 NW_HOL.6.t: "Collapse of the Stalinist Line"
 NW_HOL.6.d: "Since 1935, the Comintern had been promoting the Popular Front line of uniting all socialists against fascism, which gained considerable support among the members of the International and allowed it to attract new supporters.\nHowever, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union struck like a lightning. Although it was praised by the leaders of the CPN as a brilliant move by Stalin, not everyone agreed with this view, which led to turmoil and confusion in the ranks of the Dutch Communist Party. Belief in communism was severely tested for many party members, and about two thousand left the party altogether to join more radical forces."
 NW_HOL.6.a: "The leftists will never agree among themselves"
 NW_HOL.6.b: "These are only temporary difficulties"
 NW_HOL.7.t: "Conflict Between the NSV and the FIS Ends"
 NW_HOL.7.d: "Eikeboom reacted to the conference's accusation with a furious campaign against the NSV in the newspaper De Arbeider. He was supported in this by NSV member De Bruin, who criticized the decision of the NSV congress in the same journal. It is quite clear from this article that De Bruin had confidential information about the events at the conference, although he did not attend it himself. Further investigation revealed that De Bruin had received this information from NSV member Deutekom.\n\nIn response, the Dutch Syndicalist Trade Union decided to expel these members from the union, after which they joined the opposition group. The problems around the board of the International Solidarity Fund were only resolved at a general meeting called by the NSV. During the meeting, Eikeboom was expelled from the FIS board and it was decided to return the FIS board to Groningen, where it had previously been located."
 NW_HOL.7.a: "The division among the unions is only to our benefit"
 NW_HOL.8.t: "Split in the RSP"
 NW_HOL.8.d: "Schmidt, who became chairman of the RSP after its merger with the RSAP, was expelled from the RSP along with the lawyer Stien de Zeeuw in September 1936 because of his criticism of Stalin and the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, calling the Moscow trials "show trials". He was then forced to resign from the provincial and city councils, then joined the SDAP, refusing to support Sneevliet, who took over as chairman.\n\nSchmidt's sympathy for democracy and his fear of totalitarian dictatorship were the primary reasons for the split in the Trotskyist party."
 NW_HOL.8.a: "The weaker the revolutionaries are, the better off we are"
 NW_HOL.9.t: "Disagreements between the NSV and the Young Proletariat Schools"
 NW_HOL.9.d: "After the problems around the FIS were resolved, a conflict erupted in the youth movement. The subject of disagreement was whether the councils of the Young Proletariat Schools should be appointed by parents or councils. The Young Proletariat Schools said that the decision of the April conference would not be respected. It was also revealed that they still maintained contacts with De Bruin and Deutekoma, which they refused to end.\n\nThe congress had ruled, as a matter of principle, that those who opposed the will of the union would be expelled if they persisted in their position. Because they did indeed persist in their position, the relevant departments decided to effectively expel them: ten members of the Amsterdam Metalworkers, three from the Rotterdam Metalworkers and several more from the construction industry in Amsterdam were stripped of their seats in the union."
 NW_HOL.9.a: "Nothing changes, but that's even better"
 NW_HOL.10.t: "Emergency NSV Congress"
 NW_HOL.10.d: "These two days a special congress of the Dutch Syndicalist Trade Union was held to discuss the idea of a council. It adopted a document on the councils, the contents of which were largely in accordance with the report of the council of 1932. Thereafter, a number of practical decisions were taken accordingly:\n\n\n -To transform the NSV into an organization in the commercial enterprises and industrial federations, and to regard these bodies as preparatory groups for social reconstruction;\n -To strengthen the awareness of the Dutch proletariat that the solution to all its problems can only be found in bringing the companies under their own management;\n -To prepare the workers for the takeover of the companies, among other things by studying the administration, technology, etc. of their companies;\n -Gather statistical data on the available labor force, production, consumption, and demand;\n -Focus the effort on corporate takeover;\n -Enhance and expand the struggle to increase the chance of social revolution."
 NW_HOL.10.a: "Looks like industrial espionage..."
 NW_HOL.11.t: "International Communist Group Conference"
 NW_HOL.11.d: "As a result of the conference in December 1936, the GIC joined the Free Federation of National Groups as the main theoretical body. They abandoned the publication of their press materials in German in favor of the unionist review Presse-Korrespondenz. The latter was edited by the Kau International Information Office in Frankfurt, whose task was to inform and regroup Soviet-Communist groups around the world. It was typical for these groups to turn their backs on politics to join the German Kau and the Dutch GIC."
 NW_HOL.11.a: "Soviet communism is just a utopia"
 NW_HOL.12.t: "Princess Juliana's Wedding"
 NW_HOL.12.d: "Juliana married Bernhard Friedrich Eberhard Leopold Julius Kurt Carl Gottfried Peter Count von Biesterfeld in The Hague. Juliana's witnesses were the former court lady Louise van de Poll, her uncle Adolf van Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Johan Heising and the vice-president of the Council of State Frans Beelarts van Blokland. On that day, all children in the elementary and middle schools received a poem by P. S. Boutens and a drawing by André van der Vossen: "A New Spring in Holland." After the celebration, the couple went to live in the Soestdijk Palace."
 NW_HOL.12.a: "All hail Princess Juliana!"
 NW_HOL.13.t: "Birth of the First Princess"
 NW_HOL.13.d: "Yesterday, Princess Juliana and Bernhard Friedrich had their first child, who was revealed to be a girl. She was born at 09:47 and turned out to be an exceptionally large baby. The next day her father registered the birth at Soestdijk Palace in the presence of the Prime Minister. On this occasion, the official names were announced: Beatrix (the one that makes one happy). Wilhelmina, after Queen Wilhelmina, the maternal grandmother. Armgard, after Princess Armgard, paternal grandmother. But the official name became Beatrix. Prince Bernhard said the stress should actually be on the "a," but he decided to emphasize the "e," in accordance with custom."
 NW_HOL.13.a: "Great news for the royal house!"
 NW_HOL.14.t: "A New Book Published by the Rätecommunists"
 NW_HOL.14.d: "In Amsterdam, the prominent GIC theorist Pannekoek published a book with a provocative title for any communist: "Lenin as a Philosopher.\n\nPublished under the pseudonym of John Harper, the new work can be considered - along with Theses on Bolshevism, Toward a New Workers' Movement, and Grundprinzipien - as one of the four pillars of Councilist theory. For Pannekoek and the Soviet communist movement, it was a "Marxist response" to Lenin's "Materialism and Empiriocriticism," which claimed to be the ideological conclusion of "Leninism" and was praised in the Comintern as a "deepening of Marxism" on a philosophical level.\n\nThe work aroused interest among both the proletariat and left-wing intellectuals, which attracted new supporters to the ranks of the Rätekommunists."
 NW_HOL.14.a: "Someone needs to tell them that their ideology is nothing but a utopia..."
 NW_HOL.14.b: "This will strengthen the base of our beliefs"
 NW_HOL.15.t: "October Anarchist Congress"
 NW_HOL.15.d: "A renewed resolution was adopted at the new congress. In the interest of the organization and of propaganda in general, the replacement of retiring administrators with new ones would be deemed necessary by re-electing the retiring leader only if it could not be done in any other way. Three new committees were also established to deal successively with management training, social counseling (including sickness and accident law, labor and civil law, assistance program, social insurance and taxes) and the study of social legislation."
 NW_HOL.15.a: "This won't help them get the support of more than a hundred people"
 NW_HOL.15.b: "This will strengthen us!"
 NW_HOL.16.t: "Position of Party President Established" 
 NW_HOL.16.d: "Nicholaas Beuzemaker has considerable influence over the party, but he also faces opposition, formed by Lou Jansen and Jan Dieters, led by Paul de Groot. Together they proposed the creation of the post of party president, who would take over the direct management of the party, while the chairman would only be responsible for relations with the Comintern. Clearly, the introduction of the new post would change the leadership of the party, handing power to the opposition, while abolishing it would lead to discord within the party."
 NW_HOL.16.a: "We will support this proposal"
 NW_HOL.16.b: "We should vote against it!"
 NW_HOL.17.t: "Party Leadership Reshuffled"
 NW_HOL.17.d: "Nicholaas Beuzemaker could not ignore the attempt to exclude him from the party leadership, so investigations were launched against each of the members of the opposition triumvirate. For real or fabricated reasons, each of them lost their positions in the party, leaving power in the hands of Beuzemaker."
 NW_HOL.17.a: "The party must remain united!"
 NW_HOL.18.t: "Jan Seton's death"
 NW_HOL.18.d: "One of the founders of the Communist Party of the Netherlands , who despite his withdrawal from big politics, gave the party his support, had passed away today.\n\nFor the last year, he was severely ill with lung cancer, but unfortunately, the disease struck our comrade right in the hospital."
 NW_HOL.18.a: "We shall declare a day of mourning"
 NW_HOL.19.t: "Leadership Change in the CPN"
 NW_HOL.19.d: "The Communist movement has never been known for its unity. The expulsion of Sneevliet from the CPN, then the removal of Visser by order of Moscow, and now the change of the secretariat, and thus of the entire top ranks of the party. Although Nicolaas Beuzemaker had considerable influence in the party and retained the post of party president, the trio of Paul de Groot, Lou Jansen and Jan Dieters took over the factual leadership. By creating a new post of party president, occupied by Paul de Groot, they removed Beuzemaker from the chairmanship."
 NW_HOL.19.a: "Nothing surprising"
 NW_HOL.20.t: "SDAP Labor Plan"
 NW_HOL.20.d: "In 1935, the SDAP published the "Labor Plan" (Plan van de Arbeid), which included plans to increase employment, nationalize vital industries and introduce a system of unemployment benefits. Of course, we rejected these proposals for economic reform at the time. But in the face of the lack of improvement in unemployment, we may have to give in to some socialist demands by allowing the national debt to grow to increase employment."
 NW_HOL.20.a: "We must resolve these problems"
 NW_HOL.21.t: "Strike at the Employment Center"
 NW_HOL.21.d: "A strike broke out at the Wieringermeer employment center. The reason for it was the introduction of the rotational system, that is, a system in which the unemployed were hired in alternating shifts, which in practice meant a reduction in the worker's income. Even local people supported the strikers, for example bakers sold them cheap bread and local people provided them with sleeping accommodation. Among the organizations that supported the funding of the strike was the NSV. The strike has been going on for weeks and we need to make a decision on what we should do. The strike has been accompanied by police brutality."
 NW_HOL.21.a: "Let the police deal with them"
 NW_HOL.21.b: "Send in a negotiator, we'll have to make concessions"
 NW_HOL.22.t: "Fishermen's Strike"
 NW_HOL.22.d: "In Holland, in IJmuiden, a major strike of fishermen broke out, whose strikes were organized with the active participation of the CPN. During the strike, the latter did not hesitate to propose a "united front" with the fascists. Despite their ideological differences, they put forward bold slogans: "We salute the National Socialist fishermen who are fighting in IJmuiden together with their red comrades!"."
 NW_HOL.22.a: "Let the police deal with them"
 NW_HOL.22.b: "Send in a negotiator, we'll have to make concessions"
 NW_HOL.23.t: "Strike by Unemployed Workers on the Twente-Rhine Canal"
 NW_HOL.23.d: "In Deventer, a number of workers employed at an employment enterprise on the Twente-Rhine canal went on strike due to poor working conditions. Initially, the strikers, supported by various organizations, received up to 70% of their regular pay, but later the local authorities banned collections and donations for the strikers.\n\nIn response to the strike, the municipal council repeatedly tried to send other unemployed workers to dig the Twente-Rhine canal. When most of them refused, the minister issued a decree that all support for the strikers would cease. In addition, it was no longer allowed to negotiate with the strike committee.\n\nNSV could not leave this situation unattended, and began a widespread campaign to raise funds for the strikers. With their help, the weekly collections amounted to about 700 guilders.\n\nFollowing the NSV, the GIC joined the strike and could no longer sit on the sidelines and watch what was going on. Unlike the anarchists, they took it upon themselves to help the workers in organizing the strike, because according to their view, the proletariat should help itself.\n\nIt is obvious that the situation has begun to take a bad turn, and we must do something about it."
 NW_HOL.23.a: "Let the police deal with them"
 NW_HOL.23.b: "Send in a negotiator, we'll have to make concessions"
 NW_HOL.24.t: "Amsterdam Construction Workers Go on Strike"
 NW_HOL.24.d: "The construction workers' strike that began in Amsterdam started because of the sharp rise in the cost of living. This was the reason why the construction workers demanded an increase in their allowance. When their demands were not met, they went on strike.\n\nThe strike was led by a committee from the NSV, with the active support of the CPN, the GIC and the RSP. In response, we threatened them to stop subsidizing the unemployment funds, but this only spurred the strike support movement. This strike united all the left movements in a united front. And it has shown that our subsequent actions could lead to catastrophe."
 NW_HOL.24.a: "We have to let them have their way"
 NW_HOL.25.t: "Anti-Strike Law"
 NW_HOL.25.d: "The strikes gaining strength due to the growing unemployment have almost paralyzed our country's economy. Seeing this, the parliament introduced a special law to combat them, which allows taking even radical measures to suppress the discontented."
 NW_HOL.25.a: "This is a forced measure"
 NW_HOL.26.t: "The Unemployed Workers Uprising!"
 NW_HOL.26.d: "The unemployment crisis reached a critical mass and new strikes, not so long ago banned in the country, turned into clashes with the police and then into a full-scale civil war that engulfed the whole country. In spite of their differences, the left forces united by the CPN and the RSP declared a united front for the liberation of the working class from a government that was pursuing such a fascist policy towards it."
 NW_HOL.26.a: "We shall bring revolution to our country!"
 NW_HOL.26.b: "We shall bring revolution to the world!"
 NW_HOL.26.c: "We shall defend our principles!"
 NW_HOL.27.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] The Unemployed Workers Uprising"
 NW_HOL.27.d: "The unemployment crisis in the Netherlands has reached a critical mass and the strikes suddenly turned into clashes with the police, and then into a full-scale civil war that spread throughout the country. In spite of their differences, the left-wing forces united by the CPN and the RSP put up a united front in an attempt to achieve justice by such a radical method."
 NW_HOL.27.a: "The revolution is underway!"
 NW_HOL.27.b: "This is a failure of the Dutch government"
 NW_HOL.28.t: "Recovery Works Terminated"
 NW_HOL.28.d: "The reconstruction work in our country has been completed, so in order to avoid another increase in the unemployment rate, new work brigades will be created, responsible for keeping the roads and buildings in excellent condition."
 NW_HOL.28.a: "A decision that will preserve the country's profile"
 NW_HOL.29.t: "Exclusion of the Trotskyists"
 NW_HOL.29.d: "The government of the country is a coalition of forces, led by the CPN and its secretary. In order to strengthen their position in the administration, documents were prepared to discredit the activities of Trotsky's supporters, with their subsequent dismissal from the administration."
 NW_HOL.29.a: "These are the fruits of the success of our policies"
 NW_HOL.30.t: "Clashes between Trotskyists and Anarchists"
 NW_HOL.30.d: "Not only do we have ideological differences with the RSP, but also the anarchists, who advocate the destruction of the state as such. We fueled their arguments in the council, causing more chaos in the administration, we were able to consolidate our position while the others were trying to prove their point."
 NW_HOL.30.a: "Their disagreements play to our advantage"
 NW_HOL.31.t: "Heated Debates in the Council"
 NW_HOL.31.d: "The regular convention of the country's governing council ended in heated arguments and scandals between supporters of different views on what our country should look like in the future. Because of this, we were unable to shift the topic to opponents in governance and gain more influence."
 NW_HOL.31.a: "Yet another failure of collective government"
 NW_HOL.32.t: "Sneevliet Assassinated"
 NW_HOL.32.d: "The leader of the Revolutionary Socialist Party was found dead in his own home this afternoon. This was blamed on members of the People's Militia, who were only supposed to deliver him to the council, but according to the convoy, the latter resisted and would not follow them, resulting in the tragedy."
 NW_HOL.32.a: "A horrible tragedy"
 NW_HOL.33.t: "Dissolution of the RSP"
 NW_HOL.33.d: "Having lost its leader, the RSP quickly became embroiled in disputes about who would take Snevlit's place, but having failed to reach a consensus, they decided to announce the dissolution of the party. Some of the party members joined the CPN, others the anarchist trade union, but even more strengthened the internationalist groups, which advocate the creation of a country in the image of Soviet communism."
 NW_HOL.33.a: "One problem after the other..."
 NW_HOL.34.t: "Sneevliet Flees the Country"
 NW_HOL.34.d: "Sneevliet, seeing that he had no real support in the Council, quickly realized what such a situation would lead to, so he secretly left the Netherlands."
 NW_HOL.34.a: "That's a thoughtful decision"
 NW_HOL.35.t: "Transition from Capitalism to Socialism"
 NW_HOL.35.d: "Left-wing theorists have long predicted that the first days of the transition period between capitalism and communism would be characterized by deficits. Given the need to rebuild an economy devastated by civil war and unemployment, this process will become noticeably more difficult.\n\nAs expected, a large part of the economy is in ruins, and now the immediate problem is to build up the apparatus of production and the immediate subsistence of the population. Under these conditions, we must distribute basic food supplies evenly, as we do in times of war or famine. The new moral principles of common labor have only begun their gradual formation, and it is under them that the right to consume will be linked to the performance of labor, and the old folk saying "he who does not work does not eat" will begin to express our ideology's instinctive sense of justice.\n\nThe issues of the church, where we must determine our future relationship with it, and the colonial regime in Indonesia, which, due to the chaos in our country, has begun to take over the levers of government, are no less important. We will need to overcome these problems before we can call our country socialist."
 NW_HOL.35.a: "These are only temporary difficulties"
 NW_HOL.36.t: "Distrust of the Proletariat"
 NW_HOL.36.d: "While we have been combating the fragmentation in the council, the Rätekommunists and anarchists have strengthened their support among the working class. Taking advantage of the lifting of the ban on strikes, they may turn the workers against us if our measures against unemployment and the deficit are unsuccessful. Perhaps we can successfully maneuver between the two, given their different approaches to foreign policy? After all, it is known that the anarchists are much more in favor of a peaceful path and disarmament of the army, while the Councilists want to create a world international with the support of foreign groups."
 NW_HOL.36.a: "One problem after the other..."
 NW_HOL.37.t: "Collapse of the Syndicalist Union"
 NW_HOL.37.d: "In the struggle for the minds of the workers, the anarchist propagandists suffered a devastating defeat. Furthermore, we managed to identify even the most secretive members of the trade union and arrest them."
 NW_HOL.37.a: "Another success of our policy!"
 NW_HOL.38.t: "Collapse of the International Movement"
 NW_HOL.38.d: "In the struggle for the minds of the workers, the underground brigades of internationalists were defeated. All the underground groups of Ratecommunists were identified by us and arrested, so that in the future they would not even think of stirring the minds of the workers."
 NW_HOL.38.a: "Another success of our policy!"
 NW_HOL.39.t: "A Coup by the Supporters of Soviet Communism"
 NW_HOL.39.d: "Taking advantage of the fact that our party had lost support in the eyes of the workers, the internationalist groups of communists took advantage of this and carried out a coup d'état during the next meeting of the council.\n\nThe absent Ratecommunists burst into the council chamber with the support of the people's militia, made up of the same workers who had ceased to see us as leaders. Quickly arresting all those present, including the anarchists, they announced that henceforth, the country would be governed by the soviets, not by the party!"
 NW_HOL.39.a: "Power to the Soviets!"
 NW_HOL.40.t: "Destruction of State Institutions"
 NW_HOL.40.d: "Taking advantage of the fact that our party had lost support in the eyes of the workers, the anarchists, who were absent from the next meeting of the Soviets, seized control of key state institutions, after which they cordoned off the building of the council.\n\nAfter several days of siege, the starving members of the council, unable to live to escape, were forced to surrender to the anarchists, true to their convictions and not intending to use weapons to storm them."
 NW_HOL.40.a: "Down with the state, we'll save ourselves!"
 NW_HOL.41.t: "Success of Syndicalist Propaganda"
 NW_HOL.41.d: "The anarchists took advantage of the chaos in the ranks of the proletariat to recruit some workers to help them advance their positions."
 NW_HOL.41.a: "They know what they're doing..."
 NW_HOL.42.t: "Success of Soviet Propaganda"
 NW_HOL.42.d: "The Ratecommunists continue to operate from the underground, luring some workers into their ranks to help them advance their positions."
 NW_HOL.42.a: "They know what they're doing..."
 NW_HOL.43.t: "Unsuccessful Propaganda of Syndicalists and Sovietists"
 NW_HOL.43.d: "Attempts to propagate anarchists and Sovietists among the workers failed. The proletariat has proved to be faithful to communist ideals."
 NW_HOL.43.a: "They don't know what they're doing..."
 NW_HOL.44.t: "Ousting the Communists"
 NW_HOL.44.d: "The government of the country is a coalition of forces, which is nominally led by the RSP with Sneevlit. In order to strengthen his position in the board, documents were prepared discrediting the activities of the supporters of communism, with their subsequent dismissal from the administration."
 NW_HOL.44.a: "These are the fruits of the success of our policies"
 NW_HOL.45.t: "Hotly Debated on the Council"
 NW_HOL.45.d: "The regular congress of the country's governing council ended in heated debates and scandals between supporters of different views on what our country should look like in the future. Because of this, we were not able to shift the focus to the opponents in control and gain more influence."
 NW_HOL.45.a: "Another failure of collective management"
 NW_HOL.46.t: "Clash of Communists and Anarchists"
 NW_HOL.46.d: "Not only do we have ideological differences with the CPN, but also anarchists who advocate the destruction of the state as such. We stoked their arguments in the council, causing even more chaos in the administration, and we were able to strengthen our position while the others tried to prove their case."
 NW_HOL.46.a: "Their differences are playing into our hands"
 NW_HOL.47.t: "Killing the CPN Secretariat"
 NW_HOL.47.d: "Within a week, the most prominent members of the Dutch Communist Party were found to be holding its groups together, preventing them from disintegrating. The remaining members of the CPN, who have no authority in the council, tried to blame the RSP for the incident, but in the absence of evidence, their accusations remained unfounded."
 NW_HOL.47.a: "It's a terrible tragedy"
 NW_HOL.48.t: "Dissolution of the CPN"
 NW_HOL.48.d: "Without leaders, the CPN quickly became mired in disputes over who would take over the top of the party, but while they were trying to select new leaders, many people left the party, weakening it so much that it lost its proud title. Some of the party's members went over to the RSP, others to the anarchist trade union, but an even greater number strengthened the groups of internationalists who were closest to the rhetoric of the communists."
 NW_HOL.48.a: "One problem succeeds another"
 NW_HOL.49.t: "CPN is Leaving the Country"
 NW_HOL.49.d: "The CPN, seeing that it had no meaningful support in the council, quickly realized what such a situation would lead to, so its secretariat secretly left the Netherlands, probably returning to the territory of the USSR."
 NW_HOL.49.a: "It's a considered decision"
 NW_HOL.50.t: "Lowering the Retirement Age"
 NW_HOL.50.d: "Today, the retirement age has once again been lowered, which will rejuvenate the working population and allow the elderly to relax."
 NW_HOL.50.a: "That's great"
 NW_HOL.51.t: "Disagreement Between Trotsky and Snelit"
 NW_HOL.51.d: "Gradually, the split between the RSP and Trotsky gradually grew. Similar to his attitude toward the Spanish POUM party, Trotsky reproached Sneevliet for fighting other socialists instead of uniting them. Trotsky concluded that they could not maintain such an ambiguous position: with the Fourth International in words but against it in deed.\n\nIf he did not support his policy, he threatened to set up a new section in Holland and to start an open struggle against those who could not create patient cooperation and discussion among the comrades. This ultimatum led to a complete rupture in 1938, and soon a Dutch Trotskyist group, the GBL (or Bolshevik-Leninist Group), was formed, consisting in part of former members of the RSP."
 NW_HOL.51.a: "We will give our full support to the Fourth International!"
 NW_HOL.51.b: "We will find our own allies for the revolution!"
 NW_HOL.51.c: "We will give up aggressive revolution for the sake of the world!"
 NW_HOL.52.t: "Benelux Section Proposal"
 NW_HOL.52.d: "Sneevliet, who is at the head of the Benelux section of the Fourth International, approached us with a proposal to merge our sections into one."

 NW_HOL.54.t: "Successful Implementation of Esperanto"
 NW_HOL.54.d: "Our program to introduce a common language for workers has been a success! Only a few people were able to speak it, but thanks to the ABC booklets, the majority of the workers were able to master the necessary minimum to read our international publications and the decrees of our government."
 NW_HOL.54.a: "It's beautiful!"
 NW_HOL.55.t: "Introduction of Esperanto Failed"
 NW_HOL.55.d: "Our program to introduce a common language for workers has failed. Although some workers learned the new language, it was not enough to find a common language with the locals. We will probably have to try to reintroduce Esperanto in this region."
 NW_HOL.55.a: "This is sabotage!"
 NW_HOL.56.t: "Cheap Dutch Workers"
 NW_HOL.56.d: "In spite of our reluctant collaboration with anarchists, individual firms and companies are willing to take the risk of interacting with them by being attracted by the cheapness of such labor. We need to keep a close eye on the perniciousness of the ideas that these workers will spread in our country."
 NW_HOL.56.a: "We have to be careful"
 NW_HOL.58.t: "National Socialist Movement Wins Election"
 NW_HOL.58.d: "In the wake of the popularity of National Socialism in Germany, the NSB, which was not rebuffed by the liberal forces, was able to win the last elections and gain a majority in the last parliamentary elections.\n\nHowever, the incumbent prime minister and Wilhelmina have expressed disagreement with the final results, which means a future confrontation with the leading party."
 NW_HOL.58.a: "Hou Zee!"

 NW_HOL_news.0.desc: "New parliamentary elections in the Netherlands shocked the world community when the National Socialist Movement won the necessary majority in parliament.\n\nThis result will significantly strengthen the position of the NDSAP in the region, and may indicate that the ambitions of the Netherlands will be revived."

 NW_HOL.59.d: "In the wake of the problems with unemployment, the SDLP was able to develop a working Labor Plan, due to which it was possible to significantly reduce the problems with unemployment, which raised the popularity of the party to an unprecedented height and gained a majority in the last parliamentary elections.\n\nObviously, their left-wing views will not be understood by Wilhelmina, which will lead to a confrontation between the ruling party and the royal house."
 NW_HOL.59.a: "We will protect everyone's rights!"
 NW_HOL_news.1.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] SDLP Wins Victory in the Netherlands"
 NW_HOL_news.1.desc: "The victory of the SDLP in the new parliamentary elections in the Netherlands was an expected event, given the success of the Labour Plan among the ordinary population.\n\nThis result would put the country in a controversial position, since the party's policy, although directed against the right, does not have a firm position on whether to remain with Britain, or to deviate to the left by supporting the Comintern."

 NW_HOL.60.t: "Lack of a Majority in Elections"
 NW_HOL.60.d: "As a result of the elections, none of the parties was able to gain a majority. This could lead to a crisis, as Wilhelmina explicitly stated, and commissioned the formation of a multi-party government, otherwise she would have to intervene."
 NW_HOL.60.a: "The crisis is unacceptable!"
 NW_HOL.61.t: "A Crisis in Government"
 NW_HOL.61.d: "Despite the Queen's instructions, the parties failed to form a majority, even with the support of the incumbent Prime Minister. The Queen accused each of them of spinelessness, and declared that she would personally form a new cabinet that would be under the control of the Crown!"
 NW_HOL.61.a: "The only man in our government!"
 NW_HOL_news.2.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] Wilhelmina is Preparing Her Government"
 NW_HOL_news.2.d: "Despite moderate success with the Labour Plan, the SDLP failed to gain a majority and form a new government, as it did not receive support from the Liberal parties and the Prime Minister. All this led to the fact that the Queen of the Netherlands was forced to personally mix in the crisis, and announce the formation of a new cabinet of ministers controlled by the crown. What this result will lead to is anyone's guess."
 NW_HOL_news.2.a: "Sometimes the monarch must take the burden of ruling upon himself"
 NW_HOL_news.2.b: "They took a step back..."
 NW_HOL_news.2.c: "Monarchy is a relic of the past"

 NW_HOL.63.t: "New Cabinet of Ministers"
 NW_HOL.63.d: "Prime Minister Hendrikus Coleyn's cabinet has completed its work and handed over power to the head of the SDLP, who will head the new government. When Johan Willem Albarda took up his new post, he immediately confirmed his intention to implement the course of the Social Democratic Workers' Party."
 NW_HOL.63.a: "It's a vital course"
 NW_HOL.64.t: "The Creation of the Labor Party"
 NW_HOL.64.d: "Under the influence of various politicians and affiliated parties, the Social Democratic Workers' Party changed its name to the Labour Party, which was still led by Albarda."
 NW_HOL.64.a: "Let's protect the workers!"
 NW_HOL.65.t: "[FROM.GetDemocraticParty] Proposes a Party Alliance"
 NW_HOL.65.d: "The Labour and Socialist International do not imply the hegemony of any party within their ranks, but this does not preclude the existence of different poles of power. In order to defend their vision, many parties enter into mutually beneficial alliances. Today we received an invitation from one of the parties of the International to conclude such an alliance."
 NW_HOL.65.a: "This is a great offer!"
 NW_HOL.65.b: "We're not interested"
 NW_HOL.66.t: "[FROM.GetDemocraticParty] Offers to Draw Up a Trade Treaty"
 NW_HOL.66.d: "In these difficult times, each country needs different resources, and that is why one of the parties of the International has sent a proposal for a trade treaty that will simplify trade transactions between us, and therefore significantly facilitate the turnover of trade."
 NW_HOL.66.a: "This is a great offer!"
 NW_HOL.66.b: "They have nothing of interest to us."
 NW_HOL.67.t: "Exclusion from Labor and Socialist International"
 NW_HOL.67.d: "After the change of government in our country, the question of our presence in the International became undesirable. A notice was sent to us that we were no longer a member of the Social-Democrats, and that all the previous agreements of the Social Democrats were no longer valid for our country."
 NW_HOL.67.a: "I didn't really want to"
 NW_HOL.68.t: "Re-Election Attempt"
 NW_HOL.68.d: "Acting on the Queen's orders, the incumbent Prime Minister called an emergency meeting, after which he gave a speech on the radio, where he stated that the election had been rigged by the National Socialist Party and that the results needed to be reviewed.\n\nThat evening, however, hundreds of demonstrators, wearing NSB uniforms, and thousands more, took to the streets wearing attributes expressing affiliation or support for a right-wing party.\n\nPolice were brought in to disperse the demonstration, some of whose forces were complicit with the NSB, while others were dispersed by the crowd. After this decision, the incumbent prime minister had to resign early."
 NW_HOL.68.a: "Democracy shut our mouths!"
 NW_HOL.69.t: "The New Cabinet"
 NW_HOL.69.d: "After the massive demonstrations of the NSB, the queen could no longer ignore the winning party, so Mussert was summoned to Wilhelmina's palace, where they had a lengthy conversation, after which the head of the NSB was appointed as the new prime minister.\n\nIt is likely that an agreement was reached behind closed doors that suited both sides, and now the Queen will support the young party's ambitions to retake the Great Netherlands."
 NW_HOL.69.a: "Wonderful!"
 NW_HOL.70.t: "NSB Demonstration in Genderland"
 NW_HOL.70.d: "The National Socialist Party held its annual demonstration in Gelderland, showing its strength and skill. Of course, this has brought them a bit of popularity among the radical society, but, fortunately, they are a minority."
 NW_HOL.70.a: "Useless speeches..."
 NW_HOL.71.t: "Muur van Mussert Construction"
 NW_HOL.71.d: "Today, the Mussert Wall was built, which has a free area and a small building for NSB performances. Of course, the model was taken from Germany, where there were many similar meeting places for members of the National Socialist Party."
 NW_HOL.71.a: "What do they want to achieve?"
 NW_HOL.72.t: "The Queen's Displeasure"
 NW_HOL.72.d: "Wilhelmina was dissatisfied with the election. The first thing she did when she learned and accepted the results was to express her displeasure to the prime minister, who is apparently sitting in his cabinet for the last few days."
 NW_HOL.72.a: "You'd think the queen had expressed her displeasure..."
 NW_HOL.73.t: "Intolerance of Jews"
 NW_HOL.73.d: "With the coming to power of the National Socialists, the mood in the country began to take on completely different colors. More and more people began to talk about the greatness of Holland, about the fact that the country could return to its former greatness: from the Benelux to the colonies.\n\nAgainst this background, the signs that appeared on the doors of stores with the inscription "Jews are not welcome" looked like an insignificant factor at all. But not for everyone. The Jews, who had a huge community in the country, began to be oppressed. Detachments of improvised militia began to march through their neighborhoods, provoking the locals.\n\nThis led to a clash between the National Socialists and the Jewish citizens of Holland on Rembrandt Square. A fierce battle in the heart of one of the Jewish neighborhoods resulted in one of the NSB members being seriously wounded, and dying a few days later. This fighter against the Jewish infection was buried with great pomp and honors, making a martyr out of him.nnThe tragic death only exacerbated the reaction, leading to mass emigration of Jews, and the appropriation of Jewish property by the country's authorities."
 NW_HOL.73.a: "For the glory of OUR nation!"

 HOL_fighting_unemployment_category_desc: "Unemployment was one of the areas where the crisis was most noticeable for the working class. We began to look for a solution to this problem in providing employment. This was sharply criticized by the labor unions, the situation even went so far as to mention "forced labor", since both wage and occupation were forced on the workers; the training and abilities of the individuals concerned played no role. The NSV criticized the job creations was that they increasingly included ordinary jobs such as road building, sewage systems and canal digging. This would not have been so harshly criticized if we had not had to pay these workers lower wages than is the norm in this sector of labor. The RSP and SDAP have prepared and announced complete social programs that could solve the unemployment issue, and only the CPN has taken a moderate position so far, which will undoubtedly change if this crisis worsens enough to be noticed by Moscow.\n\nIt is obvious that we must take more decisive measures to get rid of unemployment, otherwise the uprising of 1934 may not only be repeated, but also spread throughout the country with the support of revolutionaries who are well aware of the problems of the proletariat and are ready to raise it against the state power.\n\n£HOL_percentage_of_unemployed_text_icon §ONumber of Unemployed§!: [?HOL_percentage_of_unemployed|R0%%]"
