    TUR_forced_tank_production_desc: "Sooner or later, our ideological confrontation with the Bolsheviks will develop into a full-fledged war. It is obvious that we need to find an answer to the modern miracle of military equipment-tanks. Since most of the territory of Turkey is a mountainous area with small plateaus, it makes no sense for us to focus on light and medium tanks. It is the heavy tanks that should be the answer to the Soviet threat and the key to victory in the difficult mountainous terrain."

In this regard, Recep took a sharply oppositional position to us. Since he is the general secretary of the party, he will be able to start plotting behind our backs at the expense of his influence, so perhaps we should remove him from this post in order to avoid unnecessary political intrigues."

    NWturkey.77.desc: "In recent months the condition of our leader has become increasingly weakened and unhealthy. His addiction to alcohol is taking its toll, but he is also working hard to build a new Turkey. Ataturk himself realizes that his days are numbered, but the process of modernizing the state is not over, so he must decide whether he will name an heir himself, or whether Turkish society is so mature that it is ready to choose a new president on its own."

    NWturkey.78.desc: "During his military career, and later his political activities, Ataturk managed to gather around him a large circle of loyal people whom he could trust. However, at the same time, each of them has different qualities and, most importantly, political views on the future of the country. Depending on this choice, Turkey's future will be very different.\nThe main candidate is Ismet İnonu, Ataturk's closest associate and «the second man in the state». He headed several important diplomatic missions and negotiated peace with the Entente powers. Thanks to Ataturk's unrestricted disposition he was able to quickly advance in his career, but this caused the fierce hatred of many other people in Kemal's circle.\nThe other equally important candidate is Fevzi Cakmak, the head of the Turkish General Staff, the second Field Marshal of the Republic after Ataturk himself. He retired from political activity in the 20s and devoted himself to the development of the Turkish army, thanks to which he practically did not take part in the political struggle and did not make any enemies.\nAnother possible successor could be Mahmud Caelal Bayar, a democratic party leader appointed by Ataturk as prime minister a year ago. He holds liberal economic views, is a good economic manager, he ran the Business Bank of Turkey for more than 8 years. In addition, he participated in many negotiations with European powers.\nThe dark horse could be Şukru Kaya, the permanent Minister of the Interior of the Republic, recently appointed as Secretary General of the People's Republican Party. In his main position he was engaged in suppressing Kurdish unrest in the southeast of the country, so in the current turbulent situation he will be able to keep power and maintain stability in the country."

    NWturkey.79.desc: "Despite being offered the presidency personally by Ataturk, Fevzi Cakmak has stated that he does not wish to return to politics because he understands that at the moment there are people in Kemal's entourage who can lead the country in such a difficult period better than he can. By these «people» we mean Ismet Inonu, an associate of both Ataturk and Cakmak, so it is not surprising that Fevzi is ready to hand over the post to him quietly."
    NWturkey.79.a: "So Ismet Inonu after all"

He headed several important diplomatic missions and negotiated peace with the Entente powers. Thanks to Ataturk's unrestricted disposition he was able to quickly advance in his career, but he caused the fierce hatred of many other people in Kemal's circle.\nThe alternative seems to be Recep Peker, the developer of fascist reforms and adaptation of this ideology for our country, who currently heads the people's-republican party. This is a man with well-established views, who will be able to further carry out the modernization of the country.\nAnother equally important candidate can be called Fevzi Cakmak - the head of the Turkish General Staff, the second Field Marshal of the Republic after Ataturk himself. He left political activity in the twenties and devoted himself to the development of the Turkish army, which is why he almost never participated in political struggles and made no enemies.\nThe dark horse could be Şukru Kaya, the permanent Interior Minister of the Republic, who was recently appointed Prime Minister. In his main position, he was engaged in suppressing Kurdish unrest in the southeast of the country, so in the current turbulent situation he will be able to hold power and maintain stability in the country."

Only Fevzi Cakmak could he entrust the post of president of the republic in the event of his death. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey supported this still lifetime proposal of Kemal. In the coming new world struggle, Cakmak will be able to hold power firmly in his hands and prevent a repetition of the mistakes of the Ottoman leadership."

    NWturkey.82.t: "Mahmoud Celal Bayar elected as new president"
    NWturkey.82.desc: "Having received the support of Ataturk in the last years of his life, Mahmud Celal Bayar was able to gain the trust of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and take over as president of the republic. His liberal views on the economy and the state managed to resonate with Kemal. For a long time in this struggle for loyalty he fought with İsmet İnonu, but the similarity of views between Ataturk and Bayar allowed him to win."

    NWturkey.83.t: "Şukru Kaya elected as new president"
    NWturkey.83.desc: "The figure of Şukru Kaya has always been surrounded by some mystery in the government and party. Holding his position as Minister of the Interior for many years, he was apparently able to win Ataturk's favor through sheer loyalty, which led him to be promoted to even higher positions in the last months of Kemal's life. By naming him his heir before his death, Ataturk ensured Sukru's eventual victory in the presidential election, which eventually happened."
    NWturkey.83.a: "The intelligence services in Turkey have never been so strong"
    
    NWturkey.84.t: "Recep Peker elected as new president"
    NWturkey.84.desc: "For several years now, Recep Peker, who has been pushing fascist reforms in Turkey and trying to get better relations with other countries that have embraced this ideology, will finally be able to complete his project. Despite some disagreements with Ataturk, the latter still gave carte blanche to his close comrade, naming him his heir, thanks to which the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, under some pressure from the Fascist Council, elected him as the new president of the republic."
    NWturkey.84.a: "Turkish democracy died in the bud"
