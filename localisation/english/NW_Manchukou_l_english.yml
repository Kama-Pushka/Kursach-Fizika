     MAN_zhang_jinghui: "Zhang Jinghui"
     POLITICS_ZHANG_JINGHUI_DESC: "Zhang Jinghui was born in Tai'an, southwest of Mukden (Liaoning Province). When the war with Japan broke out, Zhang joined the irregular Hunghuz cavalry units led by the Manchu warlord Zhang Zoling. Subsequently, these forces also took part in the Russo-Japanese War, acting on the side of Japan as mercenaries. In the last years of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zoling was appointed governor of the Three Northeastern Provinces with a base in Fengtian. After the Xinhai Revolution, which abolished the Chinese monarchy, he managed to get his power recognized within the newly formed militarized Republic of China. At this time, Zhang Jinghui was appointed commander of the 27th Infantry Brigade of the Beiyang Army, one of the largest and most capable infantry brigades within China. However, with the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the Beiyang Army split into several hostile factions, and Zhang Jinghui joined the Zhilian clique led by Wu Peifu. He later returned to Zhang Zoling and served as Minister of War in the Beiyang government from May 1926 to June 1927. On June 4, 1928, the Huanggutun Incident occurred, which resulted in the death of Zhang Zoling. Shortly thereafter, in January 1929, a conference on national unity was held in Nanjing, attended by Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Jinghui. The outcome of the conference was the recognition of the Kuomintang Party leader Chiang Kai-shek as the head of state. After the Mukden Incident and the successful invasion of Manchuria by the Kwantung Army in 1931, Zhang Jinghui convened a conference in his office on September 27, 1931, to organize the “Special Area Emergency Committee”, and the secession of Manchuria from China. On his orders, Kuomintang General Ma Zhanshan, acting governor of Heilongjiang, was expelled from Qiqihar. Zhang then declared Manchuria self-governing and proclaimed himself Manchurian governor on January 7, 1932. Fearing invasion by the Soviet Union and being unable to resist the Japanese, Zhang signed an agreement with the latter and was recognized by Japan as the only legitimate governor of Heilongjiang within the planned state of Manchukuo. On February 14, 1932, Zhang Jinghui handed over the governor's post to former adversary Ma Zhangshan, who agreed to defect to the Japanese. In April 1932, Zhang took over as Manchukuo-go's Minister of Defense. On May 21, 1935, despite objections from Emperor Pu Yi, at the Japanese initiative Zhang Jinghui was appointed Prime Minister of Manchukuo, succeeding Zheng Xiaosuya."
     MAN_zang_shiyi: "Zang Shiyi"
     POLITICS_ZANG_SHIYI_DESC: "Zang Shiyi was born in Fengtian, Liaoning Province, Qing Empire. In 1909, he was sent to Japan to study, where he first studied in Tokyo at a special school for training military personnel for the Chinese army, and then in Rikugun Shikan Gakko, before returning to China in 1911. He served under Sun Lechen of the Fengtian clique, in 1920 took part in the Zhili-Anhui War, then for a while was chief of staff of the Northwest Frontier Defense Army. In June 1924, on Zhang Zolin's orders, he returned to Shenyang when, as a result of the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, the Fengtian clique gained control of the territories south of the Great Wall - Zang Shiyi became governor-general of Jiangsu Province, from which he was later ousted by Sun Chuanfang. In 1928, after the death of Zhang Zoling, Zang Shiyi supported the unification of China, and in 1930 was appointed governor of Liaoning Province. When Manchuria was occupied by the Kwantung Army after the Mukden Incident in 1931, Zang Shiyi initially refused to cooperate with the Japanese and was thrown behind bars. He later changed his mind, and on December 16, 1931, he again became governor of Liaoning Province (which was returned to its pre-revolutionary name of “Fengtian”). When Manchukuo-go was formed in 1932, Zang Shiyi remained as governor of Fengtian Province during further changes in the administrative-territorial division. In 1935, Emperor Pu and considered him as a possible candidate for the post of Prime Minister of Manchukuo (instead of Zheng Xiaoxu). On March 21, 1935, Zang Shiyi became chairman of the Manchukuo Senate."
     MAN_aisin_gioro_puyi: "Aisin Gioro Puyi"
     POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_PUYI_DESC: "He was the nephew of Emperor Aixingyoro Zaitian, who was deprived of power in 1898 and ruled under the motto “Guangxiu”. Defined to him as his heir dowager Empress Cixi, the de facto ruler of the Qing Empire, who outlived Tszaitian (poisoned by her on November 14, 1908) for one day. Two-year-old Pui became emperor in December 1908, with his own father Aixingyoro Zaifeng, who held the title “Prince of Chun”, as regent. After the Xinhai Revolution, which destroyed the Qing Empire and led to the establishment of the Republic of China, on February 12, 1912, Tszaitian's widow, Empress Lunyu, who became regent in place of the retired Prince Chun, signed an act of abdication of the emperor. According to the terms promised to the monarch's family by General Yuan Shikai, Pui retained the title of emperor, the right to reside in Beijing's “Forbidden City”, and according to protocol was equal to a foreign monarch. In July 1917, after General Zhang Xun seized power in Beijing, Pui was briefly (for two weeks) proclaimed reigning emperor again. After troops under General Duan Qijui entered Beijing, Pui was removed from power for a second time, but the imperial family was allowed to remain in Beijing. After reaching his 18th birthday in 1924, he was deposed finally, stripped of all titles, banished with his court from the Forbidden City, and declared an ordinary citizen of the republic.  In 1925, he settled in the Japanese concession in Tianjin and organized a “court in exile” there. From then on, he was greatly influenced by the Japanese government. On March 1, 1932, under Japanese patronage, the State of Manchukuo was formed by the All Manchurian Assembly. Pui, initially appointed Head of State (under the motto “Datong”) - Supreme Ruler of the State (took office on March 9, 1932), from March 1, 1934 became Emperor of Damanzhou-digo (Great Manchurian Empire) with the motto of rule “Kande”. The coronation took place on May 10, 1934."

     POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_PUJIE_DESC: "When he was young, he was imprisoned in the Forbidden City with his brother. One day the young emperor caused a scandal when he saw his brother wearing a yellow caftan, symbolizing imperial power. In 1924, he was married to a Manchurian relative, but the couple did not live together. From 1929 he studied in Japan, where he graduated from the elite school Gakushuin and the Military Academy."
     MAN_zheng_xiaoxu: "Zheng Xiaoxu"
     POLITICS_ZHENG_XIAOXU_DESC: "Zheng Xiaoxu was born in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. In 1882 he passed the state examinations and three years later entered the civil service and was noticed by Li Hongzhang. In 1891 he was transferred to the Chinese embassy in Tokyo, and for several years performed consular duties in Tsukiji, Osaka, and Kobe. During his time in Kobe, he worked closely with the Chinese diaspora and was instrumental in establishing a Mutual Aid Association for members of his clan (kongsi). In Japan, Zheng also interacted with influential Japanese politicians and scholars such as Ito Hirobumi and Mutsu Munemitsu. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Zheng was forced to leave Japan. Returning to China, he joined the secretariat of reformist statesman Zhang Zhidong in Nanjing and soon followed him to Beijing, where he obtained a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the unsuccessful “One Hundred Days of Reform” in 1898, Zheng left the service in Beijing and went on to hold a number of important government posts in central and southern China. After the fall of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution in 1912, he refused to serve under the Republican government. He temporarily withdrew from public life, retired and settled in Shanghai, where he devoted himself to calligraphy, poetry and art. During this period, he also published newspaper articles sharply criticizing the Kuomintang.  In 1923, former Chinese Emperor Pu Yi invited Zheng Xiaoyu to Beijing to participate in the reorganization of the imperial house. Zheng, still a staunch monarchist and supporter of the Qing dynasty, became an associate and advisor to Pu Yi. He organized secret meetings with Japanese diplomats and representatives of nationalist groups such as the Amur Union to discuss the restoration of the Qing dynasty in Manchuria. After the Mukden Incident and the invasion of Manchuria by Kwantung Army units, Zheng was instrumental in the creation of the state of Manchukuo-Go, becoming its first prime minister the following year. He also authored the national anthem of Manchukuo-Go."
     MAN_aisin_gioro_xiqia: "Aisin Gioro Xiqia"
     POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_XIQIA_DESC: "Xi Qia was a Manchu and belonged to the Aisingyoro family. He was a distant descendant of Murhatsi, the brother of Nurhatsi (the founder of the Qing Dynasty). As a young man, he studied in Japan at Rikugun shikan gakko. After the Xinhai Revolution, which threw off the monarchy in China in 1911, he supported those who sought to establish a separate Manchu state. Belonging to the Fengtian clique of militarists, he became a lieutenant general and commander of the Girin Provincial Army. When, after the Manchurian Incident on September 18, 1931, Japanese troops began to advance deep into Manchuria and took the city of Girin (the capital of the province of the same name) without a fight on September 22, they invited Xi Qia to form a provisional provincial government on September 23. After meeting with local officials and Japanese advisors, Xi Qia issued a proclamation on September 30 declaring the independence of the province of Girin from the Republic of China and the establishment of a provisional government. After the Japanese occupied all of southern Manchuria in early January 1932, taking Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, they turned north to conduct a final “sweep” of Manchuria from Chinese troops. After local Chinese generals Ma Zhanshan and Ting Chao refused to negotiate with the Japanese, Japanese Colonel Doihara Kenji demanded that Xi Qia go on the offensive with his troops and knock out of Harbin grouping Ting Chao - the last major Chinese military grouping in the Northeast.  On January 25, Xi Ya approached Shuangcheng (a town 40 km south of Harbin), and on January 26, the battle with TingChao's troops began. Xi Qia's troops suffered serious losses, and Doihara was forced to call on the Kwantung Army for help; to justify this, he organized the so-called “Harbin Incident”. Shortly after the formation of Manchukuo, Xi Qia's troops suffered another defeat. On March 29, 1932, General Li Haijing's “Anti-Japanese Army to Save the Country” occupied the town of Nun'an just 40 kilometers from the Manchu capital of Xinjing. Japanese units soon drove them out of there, but such incidents, as well as desertions by soldiers of the former Northeast Army, accelerated the process of replacing them with Chinese and Manchus trained by Japanese instructors. Xi Qia was removed from his post and given a cabinet position. In 1934, Xi Qia became Manchukuo's minister of finance."

Its representatives are deputy ministers to all Manchukuo ministers and have veto power over all actions of their Manchu 'chiefs'. However, the Japanese themselves are not a monolithic structure with a single view of what Manchukuo should be, and therefore the direction in which the Kwantung Army develops depends on who is in chief.\n\nThe §HManchurian faction§!, led by §YKanji Ishiwara§!, is most favourable to us because it stands for §Ggenuine racial harmony and co-operation§! among the peoples of Asia.

Its representatives are deputy ministers to all Manchukuo ministers and have veto power over all actions of their Manchu 'chiefs'. The main problem is that we have almost no control over Manchukuo since we voluntarily agreed to let the Kwantung Army run it on its own. So now our only indirect way of influencing them is to change the leadership of the Kwantung Army itself. It must be remembered, however, that the military itself is unwilling to submit to civilian authority, so this will not be easy.

     manchukou.1.d: "Today there was an unpleasant incident with the Hujuns, the Emperor's personal guards - there was a fight between them and officers of the Kwantung Army. It is now unclear exactly who provoked the conflict, but one of the Japanese officers was wounded. The military police of the Kwantung Army have already arrested the Hujun soldiers involved.\n\nUsing this event, the Japanese command wants to finally get rid of the Hujun commander, Tong Jixu. He is known at court for his anti-Japanese views, for which he created the Emperor's loyal unit. Now Puyi must decide whether to keep Tong in his post."
     manchukou.1.a: "We'll have to reassign him"
     manchukou.1.b: "No, he's staying"
     
     manchukou.2.t: "Revenge Time"
     manchukou.2.d: "Late last year, Song Zheyuan had a plan to assassinate the emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo to destabilize that state and try to liberate northeast China from Japanese invaders. He shared this plan with a close acquaintance from his time serving under Marshal Feng Yuxiang, Sun Dianying, who had lost his army in 1934 and was living in seclusion in Shanxi Province. He, being a famous Chinese bandit and soldier, approved the plan and also suggested a candidate for the assassin - his proven commander Jin Xianzhang. According to the plan, he and 40 other soldiers would go to Inner Mongolia and surrender under the guise of bandits to the collaborationist armies being formed there. After that, they will try to penetrate into the territory of Manchukuo, where they will make an assassination attempt on Emperor Puyi."
     manchukou.2.a: "Start the operation"
     manchukou.2.b: "However, the destabilization of Manchukuo is not to our advantage."
     
     manchukou.3.t: "Replenishment of the Army"
     manchukou.3.d: "Various soldiers from the territories under our control continue to join our army. These are often former bandits or remnants of disbanded Chinese formations who have lost their jobs but can do nothing more than fight."

     manchukou.4.t: "Assassination of the Emperor"
     manchukou.4.d: "Today, during Puyi's inspection of the new units of the Imperial Manchurian Army, a terrible incident happened - a group of several soldiers of the newly formed unit opened fire on their emperor. A firefight began during which several more people were injured, but the attackers accomplished their main task - Puyi died very quickly from loss of blood, it was impossible to help him. The assassins did not surrender alive in the end.\n\nIt is assumed that this could happen because recruitment to the Manchu army is quite simple and enemy spies could easily infiltrate it. This is due to the need to form mass units to establish control over the entire territory of Manchukuo and suppress bandit formations."

     manchukou.5.t: "Fate of the Imperial Throne"
     manchukou.5.d: "After the assassination of Emperor Puyi, the most important issue of Manchukuo's existence - its constitutional organization - was raised again. In the early 30s, two options were considered: monarchy and republic. In the end, the first option won and Puyi became emperor, not president. But now, after his assassination, despite the existence of a legitimate and pre-selected heir to the throne, the republicans again raised their heads and proposed to switch to a republican form of government, which is more popular among the Chinese."
     manchukou.5.a: "Long live Emperor Pujie!"
     manchukou.5.b: "Long live Emperor Yuyan!"
     manchukou.5.c: "It's worth going back to the Republic option"
     
     manchukou.6.t: "Regime Change"
     manchukou.6.d: "After some debate among the representatives of the Concordia Association, with the approval of the Kwantung Army Command, Manchukuo changes its form of government from a monarchy to a republic. This is more in line with the demands of the common people, who are tired of centuries of oppression, and also suits the intelligentsia. In addition, the issue of succession to the throne will not be as acute as it was under the monarchy. Emperor Puyi's brother Pujie was elected president of the new republic."
     manchukou.6.a: "However, this will do little to change the internal politics of the state"

But now, after his assassination, the republicans raised their heads again and proposed to switch to a republican form of government, which is more popular among the Chinese.\n\nDespite the fact that no heir had been chosen before Puyi's death, nothing prevents it from being done now, especially since there is a very convenient candidate in the person of the dead emperor's brother, Pujie. He has spent the last years of his military training in Japan, so he will be more inclined to work on the terms of the Kwantung Army."
     manchukou.7.a: "Long live Emperor Pujie!"

     manchukou.8.t: "Unsuccessful Assassination of the Emperor"
     manchukou.8.d: "Today, during Puyi's inspection of the new units of the Imperial Manchurian Army, an unpleasant incident occurred - a group of several soldiers from a newly formed unit opened fire on their emperor. A firefight broke out, during which several more people were injured, but the attackers were unable to fulfill their main task - Puyi was saved by soldiers of his personal guard, who covered him from the bullets. In the end, the assassins did not surrender alive.\n\nIt is assumed that this could happen because recruitment to the Manchu army is quite simple and enemy spies could easily infiltrate it.

     manchukou.14.d: "A meeting of the governors of the four provinces of Xing'an was held today in Xinjing, the capital of Manchukuo. The most active speaker at this meeting was Lin Sheng, the head of northern Xing'an. Sheng criticized the Japanese Kwantung Army Command's “national policy” toward Manchukuo: he opposed Japan's immigration plan to send a group of colonists to the four Xing'an provinces from its interior; criticized the imposition of Japanese as the country's “national language”; opposed Japanese officials having real power over Mongolian governors; and opposed the division of eastern Inner Mongolia into four Xing'an provinces.\n\nBecause of the harsh words, the Japanese officials who presided over and ran the meeting were stunned and enraged. Of course, they did not and could not accept Lin Sheng's attacks on the established “national policy” of Manchukuo. Besides, Lin Sheng's various actions in the past had already aroused their discontent. So far, it is difficult to predict where such remarks by a sufficiently important state politician might lead."

After his arrest, Lin Sheng and the others were brutally tortured at the Japanese gendarmerie headquarters in Hailar, but none of them confessed to the crimes listed by the Japanese, nor did they confess to any facts of “treason” or accuse others. During the torture, Lin Sheng took responsibility for all of them, saying: “Others are innocent, I am responsible for this alone, don't involve others.” He will now have to stand trial"

     manchukou.17.d: "Emperor Puyi learned of the incident with Lin Sheng. One of his younger sisters was engaged to Lin's son, so it turned out to be a very personal matter for the emperor. He asked Kenkichi Ueda, commander of the Kwantung Army, to help Lin Sheng in some way, to which Ueda informed him that the matter was settled because Lin had already been convicted by a Japanese military tribunal for “conspiracy to rebel.” Puyi was extremely saddened by this news, and in addition, he had to cancel his sister's marriage."
     manchukou.17.a: "Apparently, nothing can be changed"
     
     manchukou.18.t: "Execution"
     manchukou.18.d: "Lin Sheng and others were stripped of their medals. The Japanese Kwantung Army command sentenced Lin Sheng and the others to death. Before they were killed, their family members were called to a meeting at Xinjing Prison. At this moment, they knew they would be killed, but they were still strong. As they said their farewells, Ling Sheng knelt on the ground and bowed to his old father Guifu. In prison, Lin Sheng wrote a will of over 1,000 words in Manchu language that the Japanese had harmed him because of protecting local interests, which caused their displeasure and hatred."
     manchukou.18.a: "Sad end"
     
     manchukou.19.t: "Outcome of the Accident”
     manchukou.19.d: "After Lin Sheng and others were executed, the Japanese Kwantung Army Command developed and issued a secret manual that was distributed to “Japanese” officials in puppet Manchukuo with 30 articles. The first article of the manual states that “the Japanese nation is the nucleus of the various ethnic groups in Manchuria and the natural guide” and that “the status of the Japanese in Manchuria is not that of a stranger, but that of a master.” Mongol self-government in the east was finally abolished. “The Lin Sheng incident” caused a great shock among the officials of the ‘Manchurian faction’ of Manchukuo-Go, many sincerely interested in the success of this project received a dose of fear for their fate and lost any enthusiasm for the work."
     manchukou.19.a: "Now the pan-Asiatism and harmony of the five races has finally become an empty space"
     
     manchukou.20.t: "Manchurian Uprising"
     manchukou.20.d: "During Emperor Puyi's regular tour of the country to inspect Manchurian army units, the former Chinese bureaucracy, dissatisfied with the strengthening of the repressive apparatus and the loss of any levers of control over the country, decided to use this opportunity to revolt against their Japanese patrons. Puyi's departure to join his own troops from Xinjing, where he was under the almost constant control of the Japanese military, allowed the rebellion to happen and gave confidence to the Manchu armies, who killed Emperor Puyi's Japanese guards.\n\nThe too much political freedom that the Japanese gave to Manchukuo politicians, the creation of Manchukuo's own army, and the subsequent strengthening of the repressive apparatus led non-Japanese politicians to try to rebel. Only a few from among the cabinet and the emperor's entourage remained on the Japanese side. One of them was the powerless Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui, who from the very beginning had been in favor of a republican system in the state."
     manchukou.20.a: "We must defeat these traitors"
     manchukou.20.b: "It's time to break free from Japanese rule"
     
     manchukou.21.t: "Manchurian Uprising"
     manchukou.21.d: "Trouble does not come alone. A large-scale guerrilla uprising finally broke the stability of the political regime in Manchukuo and most of the non-Japanese bureaucratic staff decided to organize their own uprising against Japanese rule. It began during Emperor Puyi's visit to the Manchu troops to inspect their condition. This allowed the rebellion to happen and gave confidence to the Manchu armies, who killed Emperor Puyi's Japanese guards.\n\nThe too much political freedom that the Japanese gave to Manchukuo politicians, the creation of Manchukuo's own army, and the subsequent strengthening of the repressive apparatus led non-Japanese politicians to try to rebel. Only a few from among the cabinet and the emperor's entourage remained on the Japanese side. One of them was the powerless Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui, who from the very beginning had been in favor of a republican system in the state."
     
     manchukou.22.t: "Large-Scale Uprising in Manchukuo"
     manchukou.22.d: "The political experiment of the Kwantung Army, which began in Manchuria in the early 30s, led to its natural result - a large-scale uprising of Communist guerrillas, and after that - the collapse of the political regime itself, as almost the entire non-Japanese bureaucracy in alliance with the Manchurian army declared disobedience to the Kwantung Army and the Empire of Japan, after which it began its battles with Japanese soldiers. Emperor Puyi managed to deceive his troops before the rebellion began, thus retaining their leader."
     manchukou.22.a: "Military personnel in the Kwantung Army have failed their country again"
     manchukou.22.b: "We don't have the strength to take back Manchuria"
     
     manchukou.23.t: "Russians in Harbin"
     manchukou.23.d: "As is well known, Manchukuo is home to more than a hundred thousand Russian white emigrants who fled the Soviet regime. Among them, their own political movements began to form, which became especially popular after the arrival of the Kwantung Army on this land, as they financially supported various figures of emigration for their goals in the fight against the USSR. In addition, the lack of an enduring state authority led to the formation of several organized bandit groups divided ethnically (Russian, Korean, Chinese). Russian bandits began to work closely with the fascist parties established in Harbin in 1933, sometimes carrying out orders from the Kwantung Army and sometimes acting in their own personal interests. The Russian fascists, being influenced from Europe, veered heavily into anti-Semitism, blaming Jews for the death of Russia and other conspiracies, according to the so-called “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”."
     manchukou.23.a: "What about the Jews?"
     
     manchukou.24.t: "Case of Simon Caspe"
     manchukou.24.d: "Simon Caspe was the son of Joseph Caspe, the owner of the Hotel Moderne in Harbin, as well as most of the city's cinemas and theaters. He fled persecution from Russia and settled in Harbin in 1907, achieving French citizenship for himself and his family. His son, Simon, grew up in Harbin but studied for a time at the Paris Conservatory and was an accomplished pianist. During his summer vacation in August 1933, he was in Harbin and was returning in the evening from a walk with his girlfriend. He was accosted and kidnapped by an unknown group of persons. The next day his father received a note demanding a ransom of one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nJoseph Caspe contacted the French consul in Harbin, who delayed payment of the ransom, promising to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in the search for Simon. A month later, Caspe was sent half of his son's bloody ear. The consul again advised against paying the ransom. However, his son's body was found by the police on December 3, 1933. Simon Caspe was starved and beaten by his kidnappers, who cut off his ears, ripped out his fingernails and made him keep his head in a dark, cold pit underground when the temperature dropped to 30 degrees below zero. The kidnappers then killed him with a gunshot to the head."
     manchukou.24.a: "That's awful."
     
     manchukou.25.t: "Investigation"
     manchukou.25.d: "Thousands of people from many of Harbin's urban communities came to the funeral in protest. Almost everyone already knew about this story. It was clear to most people from the beginning who was behind this heinous crime - a gang of Russian fascists, protected by the Japanese police and the leaders of the Russian Fascist Party led by their leader Rodzaevsky. Under international pressure, the police had to arrest six suspects in Simon's murder. However, the first trial over them was delayed and ended in nothing - it was decided to hold a second trial, but the authorities began to delay its organization. Almost 2.5 years after the murder, it was time to put an end to this stupid case that was tarnishing the reputation of the entire Manchukuo project."
     manchukou.25.a: "Stand up, court is in session"
     
     manchukou.26.t: "Second Trial"
     manchukou.26.d: "The second trial of the six Russians charged with the brutal murder of Simon Caspe began today. The Japanese prosecutor immediately spoke in favor of the six defendants, calling them “Russian patriots who have raised the flag against the world danger - communism.” All this took place under the scrutiny of international journalists who had long been interested in this high-profile event, especially in light of attempts to gain international recognition for Manchukuo. It can be said that a lot depends on the fate of this case - the Japanese have established contacts with world Zionist leaders. The generals of the Kwantung Army wanted to give the Jews the opportunity, if not to establish their own state on the territory of Manchuria, then at least the possibility of free and peaceful settlement, taking into account the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. Against this background, to everyone's surprise, Chinese judges found guilty and sentenced the six Russian fascists who had tortured and killed Caspe to death."
     manchukou.26.a: "We have a chance to prove the integrity of our courts"
     
     manchukou.27.t: "Petition to the Emperor"
     manchukou.27.d: "The judges' admission of the Russian fascists' guilt and such a strict sentence created a bombshell effect: the Western media started talking about the integrity of the courts in Manchukuo, and some even spoke in favor of the possible recognition of this state. Inside Manchukuo, however, it caused a great deal of resentment on the part of some Japanese military officers, as well as Russian fascist leaders, because the Russian Fascist Party called the six defendants “martyrs for Holy Rus” and presented Puyi with a petition with thousands of signatures asking for their pardon."
     manchukou.27.a: "Puyi takes the petition, but disagrees to grant clemency to the killers"
     
     manchukou.28.t: "Execution of Murderers"
     manchukou.28.d: "After the emperor refused the Russian fascist leader Rodzaevsky a pardon for his subordinates, as well as a personal audience for negotiations, he decided to appeal to the Supreme Court of Shinkin, where all judges are under the control of the military from the Kwantung Army. However, even this did not help the chief - the judges rejected the appeal and confirmed the death sentence for the six defendants. A few days later it was carried out in Harbin City Prison, where the prisoners were held. The Jewish community greeted the decision of the state authorities with jubilation, after which many Jews who had left Manchukuo in two years announced their imminent return. International experts now predict the possible recognition of the state by some of the Great Powers, such as the United States, Great Britain or France."
     manchukou.28.a: "Sad story with a good ending"
     
     manchukou.29.t: "Supreme Court Decision"
     manchukou.29.d: "After the emperor refused the Russian fascist leader Rodzaevsky a pardon for his subordinates, as well as a personal audience for negotiations, he decided to appeal to the Supreme Court of Shinkin, where all the judges are under the control of the military from the Kwantung Army. And this changed the course of the case - the judges accepted the appeal and overturned the death sentence for the six defendants imposed by the court in Harbin. This decision was received with resentment by the Emperor, but he did not obstruct it. After this, many Jews living in Manchukuo confirmed their desire to leave that state, which undermined all Japanese plans to establish Jewish autonomy on its territory. Also now most of the international journalists who spread the news around the world recognize that the reputation of this state entity in Manchuria has fallen even lower than it was, and the chances of recognition have diminished."
     manchukou.29.a: "Japanese shot oneself in the foot"
     
     manchukou.30.t: "Sandō's Death"
     manchukou.30.d: "One of the representatives of the Mongolian nobility, Prince Sandō, one of the oldest politicians in Manchukuo, who was appointed the last head of Outer Mongolia under the Qing Empire, passed away. This fact was partly responsible for its rejection into the Russian sphere of influence. After the Imperial Japanese Army troops entered the territory of Manchuria, he agreed to cooperate with the new regime, as the Japanese abolished the oppression of Mongols in the territory of his banner."
     manchukou.30.a: "Goodbye"
     
     manchukou.31.t: "Final Suppression of the Partisans"
     manchukou.31.d: "We have succeeded in dealing with the massive partisan movement in Manchukuo, which was sponsored and supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Now nothing will threaten the civilian infrastructure, industry and colonists settling the vast territories of our nation."
     manchukou.31.a: "That should attract more investment"
     
     manchukou.32.t: "Large-Scale Bandit Uprising"
     manchukou.32.d: "We have not been able to stop the rise in popularity of the Communists. As a consequence, the number of Communist guerrilla units in Manchukuo territory has increased. We will now have to put aside all other matters and deal with the suppression of the civil uprising which directly threatens our rule in the territory of northeastern China."
     manchukou.32.a: "This should not have been allowed"
     manchukou.32.b: "It's time to liberate Manchuria from the insurgents!"
     
     manchukou.33.t: "Death of YCP Leader"
     manchukou.33.d: "The leader of the Young China Party, Zeng Qi, died today after a long illness. He had led the party almost uninterruptedly since its founding, and during that time he had managed to gain a foothold in Chinese politics with minimal power. In the end, he was able to unite with our monarchist government, after which the Young Chinese and the monarchists together began the journey to build a new China."
     manchukou.33.a: "A great loss to the country"
     
     manchukou.34.t: "Death of Prime Minister"
     manchukou.34.d: "The leader of the Young China Party, Zeng Qi, died today after a long illness. He had led the party almost uninterruptedly since its founding, and during that time he had managed to gain a foothold in Chinese politics with minimal power. In the end, he was able to unite with our monarchist government, after which the Young Chinese and the monarchists together began the journey to build a new China. As he was prime minister, the Young China Party must now choose a new leader to continue Zeng's work."
     manchukou.34.a: "Li Huang will take the reigns"
     manchukou.34.b: "Shunsheng Zuo will lead the party"
     
     manchukou.35.t: "Governor Resigns"
     manchukou.35.d: "Liu Mengen, Governor of Jehol Province, has resigned from his post. This was his personal request due to health reasons. He was an important politician in the country's governance system, known to ordinary people, soldiers and officials since the Zhili clique was in power in the Republic of China, of which he was a member."
     manchukou.35.a: "Let's hope he returns"
     
     manchukou.36.t: "Luo Zhenyu Retires"
     manchukou.36.d: "One of the founders of Manchukuo, a famous Chinese monarchist and scholar, Luo Zhengyu, resigned his posts and retired. He had long been involved in the political life of the country, having been a close friend and adviser to Emperor Puyi since 1919. It was largely due to his position and actions that Manchukuo became a monarchy rather than the republic which many other politicians favoured in the early 30s. However, he became disillusioned with the fact that most of the levers of power were in the hands of the military from the Kwantung Army and decided to devote the rest of his life to academia."
     manchukou.36.a: "We will manage without him"
     
     manchukou.37.t: "Sasaki Tōichi Leaves"
     manchukou.37.d: "Sasaki Tōichi, the man who had spent all these years trying to turn Manchukuo into a beautiful country of the future that would show the world the unity and greatness of the Asian peoples, could no longer stand the conditions imposed by the Kwantung Army. He reported that he viewed the Mukden incident as a 'revolution' that had liberated the people of Manchuria from 'feudal' rule and as an attempt to establish a modern 'moral state' based on multi-ethnic harmony. On his arrival in Manchuria, however, Sasaki was disappointed. During his time as a military adviser, he repeatedly advised Japanese officers to rid themselves of their 'sense of superiority' over the Chinese. He noted that five years after its establishment Manchukuo-Go had not become an 'independent state' and that continuing to refer to it as such was nothing but 'self-deception'. He also noted that the Manchurian army was not united by any noble national ideal, but by a comprehensive system of punishment and reward."
     manchukou.37.a: "We can't deal with it"
     
     manchukou.38.t: "No Heir"
     manchukou.38.d: "When it came to the question of what kind of state system Manchukuo should have, one of the arguments put forward by the supporters of the republic was the problem of succession to the throne, since Emperor Puyi had no children. The monarchists were able to persuade their rivals by promising to resolve the issue of succession in the future.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this problem. The first is to declare Puyi's brother Pujie, who is studying at a military academy in Japan, as the heir to the Manchurian throne. This is the most logical option, but the Emperor himself does not like it because of his resentment and distrust of his brother. As an alternative, he personally sees his distant relative Yuyan, who has recently arrived and is now living with him in Xinjing, and with whom he has become very close during this time."
     manchukou.38.a: "Pujie is the only adequate choice"
     manchukou.38.b: "Let's take a risk and choose Yuyan"
     
     manchukou.39.t: "No True Heir"
     manchukou.39.d: "Despite the selection of Pujie as the presumptive heir, long-standing Manchu tradition has always required the emperor to choose a person from the next generation as heir, and therefore Pujie has no rights to the throne. Now that the 'presumptive' heir has been chosen, the Japanese will surely wish to marry his brother to a suitable candidate, such as a Japanese aristocrat or member of the Japanese Imperial House, to infuse the Manchu bloodline. As he is now being educated in Japan, he will be exposed to as much Japanese agitation as possible.\n\nIn fact, Pujie had a wife. The Emperor's brother married a Manchurian noblewoman Tang Shixia in 1924, but the relationship did not go well, as the marriage was more of a convenience. In 1926, Tang became the mistress of 'Young Marshal' Zhang Xueliang and broke off relations with Pujie and his family. As a result, he never had any children. Speaking of Tang Shixia, she is now known to be dating another Chinese playboy, Lu Xiaojia, son of General Lu Yongxiang, a prominent member of the Anhui clique. Together with Zhang Xueliang, Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-sen, and Duan Hongye, son of Duan Qirui, they make up the so-called 'Four Sons of the Republic of China', the second generation of military leaders."
     manchukou.39.a: "So what about the heir to the throne?"
     
     manchukou.40.t: "Puyi's Plan"
     manchukou.40.d: "However, Puyi has a plan to stop Japanese interference in the Manchu imperial clan: he will try to marry his brother to one of the Manchu nobles. He has in mind his cousin, one of the most beautiful girls in the Aisin-Gioro clan, Wang Mintong. Long ago, she herself was one of the candidates for his wife, but Emperor chose Wanrong. Now he invites her to come urgently to Xinjing to meet Pujie, to whom Puyi has also written a letter asking her to meet him in Manchukuo as soon as possible."
     manchukou.40.a: "The Emperor's chances are slim, but they are there"
     
     manchukou.41.t: "Tang Shixia Scandal"
     manchukou.41.d: "During the Emperor's trial with his brother and his marriage, an unpleasant fact came to light. It turned out that his first wife, Tang Shixia, had not only become the mistress of another Chinese military leader, but had also begun to steal jewellery from Pujie's house in Peking, to which she still had access after their divorce. Apparently it was her new boyfriend, Lu Xiaojia, who put her up to it. Pujie himself had no way of knowing what was going on, as he had been training in Japan for the past few years. Puyi decided to tell him the story in person."
     manchukou.41.a: "She is a disgrace to the Aisin-Gioro clan"
     
     manchukou.42.t: "Manchukuo's Heir"
     manchukou.42.d: "Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo has no heirs and is unlikely to produce any. He is also rather stubborn and unlikely to agree to marry a candidate we favour. This raises the question of succession. So far, his brother Pujie has been chosen as the 'presumptive heir', but old Manchu tradition has always required the emperor to choose a person from the next generation as heir, so he has no right to the throne. However, Pujie is currently divorced from his first wife, with whom he had an unhappy relationship, and has no children from that marriage. This opens up great opportunities for us, as we can offer him a marriage to a representative of the Japanese aristocracy or even a member of the Imperial House, thanks to which their descendants of Japanese blood will be able to become Emperors of Manchukuo. Now that he is in Japan for training, he is exposed to our agitation as much as possible."
     manchukou.42.a: "We need to select a suitable candidate"
     
     manchukou.43.t: "Puyi's Intervention"
     manchukou.43.d: "Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo is trying to interfere with our plan to marry his brother to our candidate. He urgently invited his cousin Wang Mintong and his mother to Xinjing and wrote a letter to his brother Pujie asking him to return to Manchukuo immediately after completing his studies at the Tokyo Military Academy."
     manchukou.43.a: "We must stop this activity immediately"
     manchukou.43.b: "Perhaps by leaving Pujie alone, Puyi will become more cooperative with us"
     
     manchukou.44.t: "Plans Destroyed"
     manchukou.44.d: "When the Japanese military in the Kwantung Army learned of the Emperor's plan to marry his brother to a girl from the Aisin-Gioro clan, they were so displeased that they demanded that Wang Mingtong and her mother return home from Xinjing, and the Emperor's brother Pujie was apparently never informed of the planned marriage. They seem to have plans of their own for his marriage."
     manchukou.44.a: "That's despicable"
     
     manchukou.45.t: "Candidates for Pujie"
     manchukou.45.d: "Pujie had a good relationship with General Shigeru Honjō, a supporter of the Imperial Way Faction and one of the main instigators of the Mukden Incident in 1931. Over the past few days, he had hurriedly picked up several Japanese women of his choice for the Manchukuo Emperor's brother. Today he showed their pictures at a meeting with Pujie. After careful consideration, he chose Hiro Saga, daughter of Marquis Saneto Saga and a distant relative of Emperor Hirohito."
     manchukou.45.a: "It's a good choice"

     manchukou.46.t: "Pujie's Engagement"
     manchukou.46.d: "The engagement of Pujie, the younger brother of Emperor Puyi, to Hiro Saga, the daughter of a Japanese marquis and distant relative of Emperor Hirohito, was held today at the Manchukuo embassy in Tokyo. Pujie had just graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, so the ceremony was attended by numerous Japanese military officials, along with journalists and the bride's family. Interestingly, Pujie had not informed his brother about the engagement beforehand, which meant Emperor Puyi was unable to attend."
     manchukou.46.a: "This is a betrayal"
     manchukou.46.b: "Our plan does work"

     manchukou.47.t: "Pujie and Hiro Saga's Wedding"
     manchukou.47.d: "After Pujie and Hiro Saga got engaged, a grand wedding was held at the Imperial Army Hall in Tokyo. The event drew a large crowd of distinguished guests, but Pujie's brother, Emperor Puyi, refused to attend. It is widely believed that Puyi had become distant towards his brother after learning that Pujie had secretly decided to marry a Japanese woman without informing him."
     manchukou.47.a: "This gap between the two has been apparent for a few years now"
     manchukou.47.b: "Puyi should accept his brother as he is"

     manchukou.48.t: "Return of Pujie"
     manchukou.48.d: "After spending several years training in Japan, Pujie returned to Manchukuo, this time accompanied by his new wife, Hiro Saga. They settled in Xinjing, the capital, close to Emperor Puyi’s palace. However, the relationship between the brothers quickly deteriorated after Pujie's marriage. Puyi saw it as a personal betrayal and grew suspicious of Hiro, believing she might be a Japanese spy. At their first dinner together, Puyi refused to eat the food Hiro had served him, and he rarely had the open, candid discussions with his brother that they once shared about important matters."
     manchukou.48.a: "Puyi is increasingly closing himself off from the outside world"

     manchukou.49.t: "Warming Relationship"
     manchukou.49.d: "Puyi had recently become quite secretive, avoiding open conversations in front of his brother. He even refused to eat any food prepared by Hiro Saga, suspecting she might be trying to poison him. Puyi was also pressured into signing an agreement that, if he had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised there. Over time, however, his relationship with Hiro began to improve, as she consistently reassured him that her intentions were sincere—that she had come to Xinjing as his brother’s wife, not as a spy. The mistrust between them finally dissolved when Hiro chose to abandon her Japanese kimono in favor of a Chinese qipao. She then took steps to mend Puyi’s relationship with Empress Wanrong, even arranging for them to dine together for the first time in three years."
     manchukou.49.a: "Perhaps Hiro Saga is indeed a kind and sincere woman"

     manchukou.50.t: "Plan Worked"
     manchukou.50.d: "Puyi successfully countered the intrigues of the Japanese military, although he had to recognize that this was ultimately due to the decisions and desires of the Japanese themselves. When Pujie arrived in Xinjing, he was greeted not only by his brother but also by his cousin Wang Mintong and their mother. The banquet at the imperial palace was organized by Wang, who was a skilled hostess and an excellent cook. Pujie and Wang sat side by side, engaging in quiet conversation despite having only recently gotten to know each other. The lively atmosphere of the banquet lifted Puyi’s spirits, which had been low for the past few months; he drank heavily and entertained the guests with jokes. His jovial demeanor was likely a reflection of his relief that his plan was working and that he could finally thwart the Japanese influence."
     manchukou.50.a: "A Japanese, a Russian and a German walk into a..."

     manchukou.51.t: "Pujie and Wang Mingtong's Wedding"
     manchukou.51.d: "The wedding of Pujie, Emperor's brother, and Manchurian aristocrat Wang Mingtong, who is his close relative, took place today in Xinjing. Despite the circumstances, both the bride and groom seemed happy with each other. Many people who had previously been barred from entering the capital of Manchukuo were also able to attend the celebration."
     manchukou.51.a: "This gives us confidence in the country's future"

     manchukou.52.t: "Resettlement of Korean Group"
     manchukou.52.d: "The programme for the resettlement of poor Korean peasants in Manchukuo launched jointly by our government and the Japanese government is being carried out. The Xinjing office is working on the programme, while the Seoul office is collecting information and offering the scheme to the Koreans."
     manchukou.52.a: "The plan is working"

     manchukou.53.t: "The Fugu Plan"
     manchukou.53.d: "A group of Kwantung Army officers, known as the 'Manchurian faction', promoted the idea of working closely with international Jewish leaders to attract Jewish migrants to Manchukuo, where they could be provided with comfortable living conditions. The present situation in Europe and increased anti-Semitism have caused another wave of emigration, and in Palestine the British authorities have created difficult conditions for Jews to obtain citizenship. We should seize this opportunity to improve our international reputation by giving Jews a new home in Manchuria. Moreover, there is a large Jewish lobby in the United States, and with its help we can try to persuade the United States to recognise our supremacy in the Asian region. These are the ideas of the Manchurian faction of the military."
     manchukou.53.a: "They can take control of the issue"
     manchukou.53.b: "Jews can migrate to the sphere under our control if they want to"
     manchukou.53.c: "We don't care about Jewish problems"

     manchukou.54.t: "Jewish Question under Military Control"
     manchukou.54.d: "Tokyo gave the Kwantung Army complete freedom of action on the Jewish question. In this way we can begin to implement various Zionist projects by contacting international Jewish leaders and their organisations."
     manchukou.54.a: "Great news"

     manchukou.55.t: "Tokyo Takes Jewish Question under Its Control"
     manchukou.55.d: "The politicians in Tokyo agreed that Jews could be useful to the Empire of Japan, but we should not go too far into the matter, lest we spend the resources needed for warfare on a rather adventurous project that has a chance of not materialising.

     manchukou.57.t: "Location of Jewish State"
     manchukou.57.desc: "The territory of Manchukuo is large enough to allow us to choose a suitable location for the proposed Jewish state. One option is the former Chinese province of Jehol, which would create a 'buffer' zone between us and the Chinese territories. Another viable choice is the modern province of Xing'an, which has a partially Mongolian population but a weak Mongolian aristocracy. This could help us align the interests of the Mongols with those of the Jews, preventing any thoughts of secession in favor of Mongolian states. We could also consider the Liaodong Peninsula and the city of Mukden, which would help balance the Manchu population and aristocracy in those areas. Lastly, we should explore land in the USSR, where the so-called Jewish Autonomous Oblast was established as a Bolshevik project to create a Jewish state. Since there is already a Jewish population there, we could facilitate their reunification while also displacing the Russians, assuming we can maintain control of the region."

Only the great empire of Japan was able to offer them such a home."

     manchukou.59.d: "The revolt of the Manchuria clan led by Emperor Puyi against the Japanese rulers triggered a new wave of patriotic anti-Japanese movement. Many of the latent monarchists who remained in Chinese society became active, thus beginning a new rise in the popularity of the monarchy, which seemed to have died after the last two pathetic attempts at restorations."
     manchukou.59.a: "It can't threaten our power"

     manchukou.60.t: "Promise to the peasants"
     manchukou.60.d: "Our government issued an appeal to the peasants to join the Manchurian army for the sake of universal resistance to the invaders. In exchange, the government pledged to initiate long-awaited land reform after defeating the Japanese. But we should not delay its fulfilment after the victory over the Japanese - after some time the mood of the peasants will change and they may revolt against us after being exposed to communist propaganda."

     manchukou.61.d: "The revolt of the Manchuria clan led by Emperor Puyi against their Japanese overlords sparked a new wave of patriotic anti-Japanese movement throughout China. Many of the latent monarchists who remained in Chinese society began to raise up, thus beginning a new rise in the popularity of the monarchy, which seemed to have died after the last two pathetic attempts at restorations. The leaders of the existing Chinese community in our country also began to try to get help for their rebellious comrades in Manchuria."

     manchukou.62.t: "Manchurians offer co-operation"
     manchukou.62.d: "The Manchurian Imperial Court with its army rebelling against the Japanese invaders in the person of the Kwantung Army proposes to organise cooperation against common enemies, as in the current situation only unification and a united anti-Japanese front can save the country. In this way, we may be setting a good example for all other Chinese politicians. After the war, the monarchists intend to establish a constitutional regime where the Young China Party will be able to come to power in a completely legal way, without relying on the militarists' methods of force."

     manchukou.64.a: "Neither fish nor fowl"

     manchukou.65.t: "Return to Mukden"
     manchukou.65.d: "After a hard-fought war of independence, the imperial court finally returns to the true Manchuria capital, the city of Mukden, as Puyi had dreamed of for so long. He always had trouble tolerating Xinjing, where the Japanese tried to lock him up. The town was artificial, built from a small village early in this century. The Japanese clearly showed who was more important in Manchukuo-Go - the Kwantung Army General Staff building was several times larger than the Emperor's palace. Now, at last, Puyi will finally be able to realise his next dream of becoming emperor of all of China once again by conquering it, repeating the success of his ancestors.\n\nHowever, during the liberation period, several factions have formed in our independent government that will try to push their vision of a future monarchy through. They may be so strong that Puyi will be their puppet again."

     manchukou.68.t: "Peasant uprising"
     manchukou.68.d: "Delaying agrarian reform for too long led to growing peasant discontent and the spread of communist ideas among them. CCP agents infiltrated their ranks, smuggled weapons into the territory under our control, and conducted propaganda among some of our army, after which they started an uprising in several regions."
     manchukou.68.a: "Another enemy"
     manchukou.68.b: "It's time to break free of the oppression!"

     manchukou.69.t: "The fate of the polity"
     manchukou.69.d: "Manchuria is once again entering a difficult period of political reform, which it needs. Puyi and the rest of the court are already familiar with this from the events of the early 30s when Manchukuo-Go was being formed, but then the Japanese military, now gone, also played a huge role. However, that doesn't mean there isn't a big fight going on within the government apparatus over what Manchuria and possibly all of China will be like. In order to resolve these issues, the temporary martial law imposed during the confrontation with the Kwantung Army must be lifted."
     manchukou.69.a: "A period of political turbulence is beginning"

     manchukou.70.t: "Dangerous alleys of Mukden"
     manchukou.70.d: "Chinese Youth Party leader Zeng Qi was assassinated in Mukden today while travelling from the imperial palace to his hotel where he is temporarily staying. His car was fired upon by several unknown men in a not very crowded alley in the city, after which they immediately fled the scene. Along with the politician, his driver was killed and the car hit the wall of the house due to loss of control.\n\nThis shocking incident has already raised a number of questions, as it occurred just before the emperor suggested that the politician put forward the Young Chinese draft constitution as the main option. The assassination was clearly planned by opponents of the Chinese Youth Party, as without their main leader they will lose their already low level of support."

     manchukou.70.b: "Military counterintelligence will handle this extraordinary case"

     manchukou.71.d: "Our newly formed police force has taken up the investigation into the murder of the Chinese Youth leader, uncovering many inconvenient facts, the official publication of which will lead to strong political changes. A report by the chief of the Mukden Police Department said that the assassins of Zeng Qi were linked to the army's top officers, who were totally dissatisfied with the Young China Party's vision of China."
     manchukou.71.a: "Let's publish the results of the investigation"
     manchukou.71.b: "Classify the data"
     manchukou.71.c: "We're going to purge the army"

     manchukou.72.t: "Military demands martial law"
     manchukou.72.d: "The military counter-intelligence conducted its own investigation into the murder of Zeng Qi and found that the situation is very grave - the assassins were linked to the Kuomintang, probably their spy network has penetrated very deeply into our government, causing the military to request permission to return martial law to deal with Republican agents, of which there are many in our government."
     manchukou.72.a: "They could impose martial law"
     manchukou.72.b: "Martial law is not required"

     manchukou.73.t: "Dissatisfaction Chinese Youth Party"
     manchukou.73.d: "After word began to spread among the political elite that the monarch was leaning toward the option of restoring the Manchukuo Constitution written by the Japanese, many members of the Young-Chinese Party immediately opposed it. This is a very sensitive issue that resonates with the general public as well, so the Young Chinese can take advantage of this situation to gain popularity and influence the situation in their favour."
     manchukou.73.a: "The military must take control of the case"
     manchukou.73.b: "Let the outrage continue"
     manchukou.73.c: "Let's give up on that idea"

     manchukou.74.t: "Street collisions"
     manchukou.74.d: "As we had anticipated, the Chinese Young, having failed to obtain a reversal of our decision, began to work among the common people, intellectuals and students, taking them to demonstrations and demanding the abolition of the Japanese constitution of Manchukuo-Go. There have already been several clashes with the military that have resulted in several deaths. A message was passed to the leaders of the ITUC that if they do not stop these provocations, we will have to go to «extreme measures»."

     manchukou.75.t: "The arrest of the leaders of the CYP"
     manchukou.75.d: "Unfortunately, our co-operation with the China Young Party came to an end - its leaders did not want to work with us and staged several provocations, in response to which we had to arrest some of the leaders of the YCP. Somebody managed to warn their top brass, thanks to which they managed to escape from the soldiers of our army."
     manchukou.75.a: "It has undermined our reputation among the common people"

     manchukou.76.t: "The Chinese Young rebellion"
     manchukou.76.t_a: "Transition of army units to the side of the Chinese Youth"
     manchukou.76.t_b: "Mutiny in the army"
     manchukou.76.d: "Our attempt to crack down hard on people's protests and arrest the leaders of the CYP led to strong opposition from parts of the military, political and bureaucratic circles. The ill-considered action pushed the government into another serious split - the Chinese Young announced the establishment of their own government, after which a part of our army and some governors came over to their side."
     manchukou.76.d_a: "Emperor Puyi, forcibly abdicated, wielded enormous powers. However, with each passing day of the Xinhai Revolution, fewer and fewer people were willing to obey orders from Beijing, so it was decided to abdicate the throne for the minor emperor. Since then, he was first isolated in the Forbidden City for a time and later banished from there. All these years he had been hatching plans to regain his rightful power, so it was impossible for him not to take advantage of his high popularity in society after the expulsion of the Japanese - the emperor tried to restore the system of the heavenly mandate instead of the constitution.\n\nOnce information about this began to spread among the elites, it could not but reach the members of the Chinese Young Party, which was in coalition with the monarchists. Such a drastic change in the government's course was not to their liking. Together with loyal parts of the army, they revolted in parts of the controlled territories, announcing their own republican government."
     manchukou.76.d_b: "During our preparations for the restoration of Manchuria as an independent state, we missed the fact that in our army there is a faction of officers who came to us from the Ironblood Army, and therefore share the views of politicians from the Chinese Young Party, who naturally do not want to hear anything about our idea, as they have been fighting against Manchukuo since 1934. Today, these elements with loyalist soldiers have mutinied in the army, proclaiming the re-establishment of the Ironblood Army."

     manchukou.76.b: "No more Manchu tyranny!"

     manchukou.77.t: "The Chinese Young are Taking Over"
     manchukou.77.d: "The Emperor's attempt to return to the Manchukuo-Go constitution did not find favour with his entourage. Much of the military top brass proved amenable to the democratic ideas of the China Young Party, and the effective mobilisation of the common people, students and intellectuals persuaded the rest of the government to move to the demands of the protesters. The emperor has no choice but to accept the demands and adopt either the Chinese Young draft constitution or a compromise version created by a group of reformers at the imperial court."

Преступник выхватил пистолет и выстрелил несколько раз с расстояния протянутой руки, так что у Пу И не было шансов выжить. Убийцу тут же схватили и уже отправили в тюрьму, где он будет ждать судебного решения.\n\nТеперь проект принятия конституции государства будет задержан, так как необходимо провести церемонию восхождения на престол нового монарха, которым станет Пу Цзе – брат императора. Некоторые считают, что это позволит императорскому двору и ближайшим политикам добиться более удобного для них проекта конституции, так как сам Пу И настаивал на расширении своих полномочий."

Всё же главным вопросом который интересовал многих, насколько новый монарх заинтересован в расширении своих полномочий согласно конституции. Когда, Пу Цзе заявил во время своей речи, что не собирается активно вмешиваться в политические процессы, то большая часть его окружения с облегчением выдохнула. Теперь на их плечах лежит выбор нового проекта конституции. Более реакционно настроенные из них предлагают сохранить главный закон Маньчжоу-Го, группа реформаторов же предлагает более либеральный вариант конституции, где полномочия монарха будут ещё более сокращены, а главную роль будет играть парламент."

Однако, с каждым днём Синьхайской революции всё меньше людей желало подчиняться приказам из Пекина, в связи с чем, за малолетнего императора было решено отказаться от престола. С тех пор он сначала на некоторое время оказался изолирован в Запретном Городе, а позже и изгнан оттуда. Все эти годы он вынашивал планы по возвращению своей законной власти, поэтому не воспользоваться высокой популярностью в обществе после изгнания японцев он не мог – император попытался восстановить вместо конституции систему небесного мандата.\n\nКак только информация об этом стала распространяться среди элит, она тут же вызвала недовольство большей их части, так как за последние десятилетия и маньчжурская аристократия, и военные, и политики вкусили власти и не желали её терять. Кроме того, они понимали, какую ненависть это вызовет у простого народа – полная ликвидация демократии и возвращении к дореволюционным принципам. В связи с этим, достаточно быстро образовался общий заговор, направленный против императора и его немногочисленных сторонников. За несколько дней до объявления реставрации абсолютизма, императора снова изолировали в его дворце, а также было срочно созвано конституционное собрание, где должен быть выбран проект конституции: либо сохранение строя похожего на Маньчжоу-Го, либо проект конституции ещё более ограничивающей монарха."

Однако бесконечно это продолжатся не может и нам нужно принимать решение, какие совершать политические шаги далее. У многих членов Младокитайской Партии возникла идея отказаться от монархии и установить республиканский режим, но стоит понимать, что популярность монарха всё ещё достаточно высока, поэтому отказ от монархии приведёт к очень тяжёлым последствиям для легитимности нашего правительства."

     manchukou.95.d: "Оказалось, что в нашем правительстве, несмотря на такое тяжелое освобождение из-под японского гнёта, остались элементы, готовые и теперь растерять все те крупицы народного доверия, которые мы заработали подняв антияпонское восстание. Си Ця, будучи главой правительства и представителем клана Айсинь Гьоро, начал подготовку провозглашения независимого маньчжурского государства на основе нашего правительства. Такой поворот встретил абсолютное непонимание со стороны большей части правительства, чиновников, военных и самого императора Пу И. У Си Ця не оказалось шансов из-за малочисленности своих сторонников. На заседании правительства под угрозой убийства его заставили сложить свои полномочия. Своим же личным указом император исключил его из действующих чинов армии."

Когда все нужные лица оказались внутри здания Законодательного собрания, Си Ця взял слово и провозгласил повторное создание государства Маньчжурия в виде монархии во главе с Пу И. Его слова сменились сначала неловким молчанием, а после малочисленными аплодисментами его сторонников. Теперь наше правительство не претендовало на остальные территории Китая и начинало проводить независимую политику, кроме того, наследуя свою легитимность от Маньчжоу-Го. Нельзя не отметить, что Си пошёл на отважный, но малообдуманный поступок, большинством своих действий лишь подрывая доверие к нашему правительству."

Воплощая замыслы 30-летней давности, маньчжурская аристократия не понимает, что мечта об отдельной стране на северо-востоке разобьётся о неповиновение преобладающего ханьского населения, а также о наступление армии любого из китайских правительств."

Таким образом, вопрос того какой язык использовать в стране является зачастую решающем для самоопределения людей. Но на территории Маньчжурии эту задачу так просто не решить, так как у этноса маньчжуров существует свой собственный язык, но знают его сейчас вероятно меньше пяти процентов населения страны. В связи с этим, нам вероятно стоит сохранить хотя бы как временное использование китайского."

However, they managed to form their own army in Manchuria and, in coalition with the monarchists, launched an uprising that drove out the Japanese invaders. This boosted the credibility of the monarchist idea in the country, and their alliance with the democratically minded YCP helped them gain a lot of credibility with the people.\n\nAll this makes it possible for our province to join the new government, which is gradually fighting the republicans throughout the country and is likely to prevail, without bloodshed.

But many smaller parties also contested the election: a splinter group of the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the State Socialist Party and the federalist China Zhi Gong Party.

They advocated democratic socialism and, against the 'right-wing' Young China Party, greater social guarantees and state control of the economy. This platform has won them the trust of the Chinese electorate, as our country remains quite poor and very diverse in terms of financial stratification."

In February 1936 we began to prepare to unite our forces: the leaders of the armies, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhou Baozhong, Zhao Shangzhi and Wang Datay, signed a declaration of the United Organisation of the Northeast Counter-Japanese United Army.

He began to peer into the formation of guards guarding his route. Something was different from the days when he had arrived here as a hostage of the Japanese military. It suddenly struck him - ordinary people! Yes, ordinary Chinese, or now Manchurians, or always Manchurians, but the main thing was their sincere desire to greet their emperor. That's the difference between today and the old days. Men take off their hats and raise them in the air, children try to peer through the rows of soldiers, women whisper and giggle. After all these years, has he finally earned this monarchical honour? The men have stopped scrounging for the bare necessities of life, and the Japanese have stopped treating them as expendable. So few words, and such a long road to this seemingly happy ending.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Emperor realises that he is still in a rather powerless position, but what is surprising is that the people he spoke of are freer and more free than he is. They now have real political representation and the ability to influence government decisions. A constitutional monarch has it more elusively. Moreover, the real 'happy ending' to the long story of the formation of Manchukuo was not thanks to Puyi, but to some extent in spite of him and his actions. This paradise was built by very different people."
