     MAN_zhang_jinghui: "Zhang Jinghui"
     POLITICS_ZHANG_JINGHUI_DESC: "Zhang Jinghui was born in Tai'an, southwest of Mukden (Liaoning Province). When the war with Japan broke out, Zhang joined the irregular Hunghuz cavalry units led by the Manchu warlord Zhang Zoling. Subsequently, these forces also took part in the Russo-Japanese War, acting on the side of Japan as mercenaries. In the last years of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Zoling was appointed governor of the Three Northeastern Provinces with a base in Fengtian. After the Xinhai Revolution, which abolished the Chinese monarchy, he managed to get his power recognized within the newly formed militarized Republic of China. At this time, Zhang Jinghui was appointed commander of the 27th Infantry Brigade of the Beiyang Army, one of the largest and most capable infantry brigades within China. However, with the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the Beiyang Army split into several hostile factions, and Zhang Jinghui joined the Zhilian clique led by Wu Peifu. He later returned to Zhang Zoling and served as Minister of War in the Beiyang government from May 1926 to June 1927. On June 4, 1928, the Huanggutun Incident occurred, which resulted in the death of Zhang Zoling. Shortly thereafter, in January 1929, a conference on national unity was held in Nanjing, attended by Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Jinghui. The outcome of the conference was the recognition of the Kuomintang Party leader Chiang Kai-shek as the head of state. After the Mukden Incident and the successful invasion of Manchuria by the Kwantung Army in 1931, Zhang Jinghui convened a conference in his office on September 27, 1931, to organize the “Special Area Emergency Committee”, and the secession of Manchuria from China. On his orders, Kuomintang General Ma Zhanshan, acting governor of Heilongjiang, was expelled from Qiqihar. Zhang then declared Manchuria self-governing and proclaimed himself Manchurian governor on January 7, 1932. Fearing invasion by the Soviet Union and being unable to resist the Japanese, Zhang signed an agreement with the latter and was recognized by Japan as the only legitimate governor of Heilongjiang within the planned state of Manchukuo. On February 14, 1932, Zhang Jinghui handed over the governor's post to former adversary Ma Zhangshan, who agreed to defect to the Japanese. In April 1932, Zhang took over as Manchukuo-go's Minister of Defense. On May 21, 1935, despite objections from Emperor Pu Yi, at the Japanese initiative Zhang Jinghui was appointed Prime Minister of Manchukuo, succeeding Zheng Xiaosuya."
     MAN_zang_shiyi: "Zang Shiyi"
     POLITICS_ZANG_SHIYI_DESC: "Zang Shiyi was born in Fengtian, Liaoning Province, Qing Empire. In 1909, he was sent to Japan to study, where he first studied in Tokyo at a special school for training military personnel for the Chinese army, and then in Rikugun Shikan Gakko, before returning to China in 1911. He served under Sun Lechen of the Fengtian clique, in 1920 took part in the Zhili-Anhui War, then for a while was chief of staff of the Northwest Frontier Defense Army. In June 1924, on Zhang Zolin's orders, he returned to Shenyang when, as a result of the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, the Fengtian clique gained control of the territories south of the Great Wall - Zang Shiyi became governor-general of Jiangsu Province, from which he was later ousted by Sun Chuanfang. In 1928, after the death of Zhang Zoling, Zang Shiyi supported the unification of China, and in 1930 was appointed governor of Liaoning Province. When Manchuria was occupied by the Kwantung Army after the Mukden Incident in 1931, Zang Shiyi initially refused to cooperate with the Japanese and was thrown behind bars. He later changed his mind, and on December 16, 1931, he again became governor of Liaoning Province (which was returned to its pre-revolutionary name of “Fengtian”). When Manchukuo-go was formed in 1932, Zang Shiyi remained as governor of Fengtian Province during further changes in the administrative-territorial division. In 1935, Emperor Pu and considered him as a possible candidate for the post of Prime Minister of Manchukuo (instead of Zheng Xiaoxu). On March 21, 1935, Zang Shiyi became chairman of the Manchukuo Senate."
     MAN_aisin_gioro_puyi: "Aisin Gioro Puyi"
     POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_PUYI_DESC: "He was the nephew of Emperor Aixingyoro Zaitian, who was deprived of power in 1898 and ruled under the motto “Guangxiu”. Defined to him as his heir dowager Empress Cixi, the de facto ruler of the Qing Empire, who outlived Tszaitian (poisoned by her on November 14, 1908) for one day. Two-year-old Pui became emperor in December 1908, with his own father Aixingyoro Zaifeng, who held the title “Prince of Chun”, as regent. After the Xinhai Revolution, which destroyed the Qing Empire and led to the establishment of the Republic of China, on February 12, 1912, Tszaitian's widow, Empress Lunyu, who became regent in place of the retired Prince Chun, signed an act of abdication of the emperor. According to the terms promised to the monarch's family by General Yuan Shikai, Pui retained the title of emperor, the right to reside in Beijing's “Forbidden City”, and according to protocol was equal to a foreign monarch. In July 1917, after General Zhang Xun seized power in Beijing, Pui was briefly (for two weeks) proclaimed reigning emperor again. After troops under General Duan Qijui entered Beijing, Pui was removed from power for a second time, but the imperial family was allowed to remain in Beijing. After reaching his 18th birthday in 1924, he was deposed finally, stripped of all titles, banished with his court from the Forbidden City, and declared an ordinary citizen of the republic.  In 1925, he settled in the Japanese concession in Tianjin and organized a “court in exile” there. From then on, he was greatly influenced by the Japanese government. On March 1, 1932, under Japanese patronage, the State of Manchukuo was formed by the All Manchurian Assembly. Pui, initially appointed Head of State (under the motto “Datong”) - Supreme Ruler of the State (took office on March 9, 1932), from March 1, 1934 became Emperor of Damanzhou-digo (Great Manchurian Empire) with the motto of rule “Kande”. The coronation took place on May 10, 1934."

One day the young emperor caused a scandal when he saw his brother wearing a yellow caftan, symbolizing imperial power. In 1924, he was married to a Manchurian relative, but the couple did not live together. From 1929 he studied in Japan, where he graduated from the elite school Gakushuin and the Military Academy."
     MAN_zheng_xiaoxu: "Zheng Xiaoxu"
     POLITICS_ZHENG_XIAOXU_DESC: "Zheng Xiaoxu was born in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. In 1882 he passed the state examinations and three years later entered the civil service and was noticed by Li Hongzhang. In 1891 he was transferred to the Chinese embassy in Tokyo, and for several years performed consular duties in Tsukiji, Osaka, and Kobe. During his time in Kobe, he worked closely with the Chinese diaspora and was instrumental in establishing a Mutual Aid Association for members of his clan (kongsi). In Japan, Zheng also interacted with influential Japanese politicians and scholars such as Ito Hirobumi and Mutsu Munemitsu. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Zheng was forced to leave Japan. Returning to China, he joined the secretariat of reformist statesman Zhang Zhidong in Nanjing and soon followed him to Beijing, where he obtained a position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the unsuccessful “One Hundred Days of Reform” in 1898, Zheng left the service in Beijing and went on to hold a number of important government posts in central and southern China. After the fall of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution in 1912, he refused to serve under the Republican government. He temporarily withdrew from public life, retired and settled in Shanghai, where he devoted himself to calligraphy, poetry and art. During this period, he also published newspaper articles sharply criticizing the Kuomintang.  In 1923, former Chinese Emperor Pu Yi invited Zheng Xiaoyu to Beijing to participate in the reorganization of the imperial house. Zheng, still a staunch monarchist and supporter of the Qing dynasty, became an associate and advisor to Pu Yi. He organized secret meetings with Japanese diplomats and representatives of nationalist groups such as the Amur Union to discuss the restoration of the Qing dynasty in Manchuria. After the Mukden Incident and the invasion of Manchuria by Kwantung Army units, Zheng was instrumental in the creation of the state of Manchukuo-Go, becoming its first prime minister the following year. He also authored the national anthem of Manchukuo-Go."
     MAN_aisin_gioro_xiqia: "Aisin Gioro Xiqia"
     POLITICS_AISIN_GIORO_XIQIA_DESC: "Xi Qia was a Manchu and belonged to the Aisingyoro family. He was a distant descendant of Murhatsi, the brother of Nurhatsi (the founder of the Qing Dynasty). As a young man, he studied in Japan at Rikugun shikan gakko. After the Xinhai Revolution, which threw off the monarchy in China in 1911, he supported those who sought to establish a separate Manchu state. Belonging to the Fengtian clique of militarists, he became a lieutenant general and commander of the Girin Provincial Army. When, after the Manchurian Incident on September 18, 1931, Japanese troops began to advance deep into Manchuria and took the city of Girin (the capital of the province of the same name) without a fight on September 22, they invited Xi Qia to form a provisional provincial government on September 23. After meeting with local officials and Japanese advisors, Xi Qia issued a proclamation on September 30 declaring the independence of the province of Girin from the Republic of China and the establishment of a provisional government. After the Japanese occupied all of southern Manchuria in early January 1932, taking Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, they turned north to conduct a final “sweep” of Manchuria from Chinese troops. After local Chinese generals Ma Zhanshan and Ting Chao refused to negotiate with the Japanese, Japanese Colonel Doihara Kenji demanded that Xi Qia go on the offensive with his troops and knock out of Harbin grouping Ting Chao - the last major Chinese military grouping in the Northeast.  On January 25, Xi Ya approached Shuangcheng (a town 40 km south of Harbin), and on January 26, the battle with TingChao's troops began. Xi Qia's troops suffered serious losses, and Doihara was forced to call on the Kwantung Army for help; to justify this, he organized the so-called “Harbin Incident”. Shortly after the formation of Manchukuo, Xi Qia's troops suffered another defeat. On March 29, 1932, General Li Haijing's “Anti-Japanese Army to Save the Country” occupied the town of Nun'an just 40 kilometers from the Manchu capital of Xinjing. Japanese units soon drove them out of there, but such incidents, as well as desertions by soldiers of the former Northeast Army, accelerated the process of replacing them with Chinese and Manchus trained by Japanese instructors. Xi Qia was removed from his post and given a cabinet position. In 1934, Xi Qia became Manchukuo's minister of finance."

The total assets of the South Manchurian Railway exceeded two billion yen, and it employed more than 53,000 employees. It was the largest company organized in accordance with Japanese law. It operated its own railway zone and remained a virtually independent entity. The Kwantung Army wanted to reorganize Mantetsu and strip it of its administrative authority and associated privileges.

It has also developed into a huge holding company that influences all aspects of Manchurian economic life. The railway zone and the extraterritoriality were on the way to the independence of Manchukuo and, as a result, to the superiority of the Kwantung Army in all aspects of life. This means that Mantetsu is forced to abandon its local administration unit. Its employees were transferred to the jurisdiction of the Government of Manchukuo. Three days later, Yōsuke Matsuoka said goodbye to the other employees who had been transferred to the new Mange Corporation. The days of greatness of the South Manchurian Railway have come to an end."

For the employees of the South Manchurian Railway, his return meant a return to the leadership of a long-time colleague. During his inauguration, when Matsuoka spoke to the assembled staff on August 29, 1935, there was a hidden concern in him: "Mantetsu is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, built at the cost of the lives of 100,000 of our compatriots. It is entrusted to our care. In short, SMR is sacred." Now the threat of restructuring involving the liquidation of Mantetsu has passed, which means that employees can calmly exhale and continue to do their duties."

In 1936, the Industrial Department consolidated the research activities of the Economic Research Association, which was established in 1932 to meet the needs of the Kwantung Army. Today, a new stage has arrived, requiring the necessary reorganization of SMR's research activities. In addition to his belief that scientific research is necessary for economic development, Matsuoka rejoiced at the fact that it was in this area that Mantetsu excelled.

Its representatives are deputy ministers to all Manchukuo ministers and have veto power over all actions of their Manchu 'chiefs'. However, the Japanese themselves are not a monolithic structure with a single view of what Manchukuo should be, and therefore the direction in which the Kwantung Army develops depends on who is in chief.\n\nThe §HManchurian faction§!, led by §YKanji Ishiwara§!, is most favourable to us because it stands for §Ggenuine racial harmony and co-operation§! among the peoples of Asia. The §HTōseiha faction§! advocates the §Reconomic exploitation of Manchuria§!, by all possible means on the model of Western countries.

     MAN_internal_leadership_of_manchukuo_desc_for_JAP: "The loud declarations of racial harmony and pan-Asian paradise have so far remained mere words, for the reality behind them is Japanese privilege and the control of all political processes by the Kwantung Army. Its representatives are deputy ministers to all Manchukuo ministers and have veto power over all actions of their Manchu 'chiefs'. The main problem is that we have almost no control over Manchukuo since we voluntarily agreed to let the Kwantung Army run it on its own. So now our only indirect way of influencing them is to change the leadership of the Kwantung Army itself. It must be remembered, however, that the military itself is unwilling to submit to civilian authority, so this will not be easy.

     manchukou.1.d: "Today there was an unpleasant incident with the Hujuns, the Emperor's personal guards - there was a fight between them and officers of the Kwantung Army. It is now unclear exactly who provoked the conflict, but one of the Japanese officers was wounded. The military police of the Kwantung Army have already arrested the Hujun soldiers involved.\n\nUsing this event, the Japanese command wants to finally get rid of the Hujun commander, Tong Jixu. He is known at court for his anti-Japanese views, for which he created the Emperor's loyal unit. Now Puyi must decide whether to keep Tong in his post."
     manchukou.1.a: "We'll have to reassign him"
     manchukou.1.b: "No, he's staying"
     
     manchukou.2.t: "Revenge Time"
     manchukou.2.d: "Late last year, Song Zheyuan had a plan to assassinate the emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo to destabilize that state and try to liberate northeast China from Japanese invaders. He shared this plan with a close acquaintance from his time serving under Marshal Feng Yuxiang, Sun Dianying, who had lost his army in 1934 and was living in seclusion in Shanxi Province. He, being a famous Chinese bandit and soldier, approved the plan and also suggested a candidate for the assassin - his proven commander Jin Xianzhang. According to the plan, he and 40 other soldiers would go to Inner Mongolia and surrender under the guise of bandits to the collaborationist armies being formed there. After that, they will try to penetrate into the territory of Manchukuo, where they will make an assassination attempt on Emperor Puyi."
     manchukou.2.a: "Start the operation"
     manchukou.2.b: "However, the destabilization of Manchukuo is not to our advantage."
     
     manchukou.3.t: "Replenishment of the Army"
     manchukou.3.d: "Various soldiers from the territories under our control continue to join our army. These are often former bandits or remnants of disbanded Chinese formations who have lost their jobs but can do nothing more than fight."
     manchukou.3.a: "They're not the best soldiers, but at least they're some"
     
     manchukou.4.t: "Assassination of the Emperor"
     manchukou.4.d: "Today, during Puyi's inspection of the new units of the Imperial Manchurian Army, a terrible incident happened - a group of several soldiers of the newly formed unit opened fire on their emperor. A firefight began during which several more people were injured, but the attackers accomplished their main task - Puyi died very quickly from loss of blood, it was impossible to help him. The assassins did not surrender alive in the end.\n\nIt is assumed that this could happen because recruitment to the Manchu army is quite simple and enemy spies could easily infiltrate it. This is due to the need to form mass units to establish control over the entire territory of Manchukuo and suppress bandit formations."
     manchukou.4.a: "What will be the future fate of the throne?"
     
     manchukou.5.t: "Fate of the Imperial Throne"
     manchukou.5.d: "After the assassination of Emperor Puyi, the most important issue of Manchukuo's existence - its constitutional organization - was raised again. In the early 30s, two options were considered: monarchy and republic. In the end, the first option won and Puyi became emperor, not president. But now, after his assassination, despite the existence of a legitimate and pre-selected heir to the throne, the republicans again raised their heads and proposed to switch to a republican form of government, which is more popular among the Chinese."
     manchukou.5.a: "Long live Emperor Pujie!"
     manchukou.5.b: "Long live Emperor Yuyan!"
     manchukou.5.c: "It's worth going back to the Republic option"
     
     manchukou.6.t: "Regime Change"
     manchukou.6.d: "After some debate among the representatives of the Concordia Association, with the approval of the Kwantung Army Command, Manchukuo changes its form of government from a monarchy to a republic. This is more in line with the demands of the common people, who are tired of centuries of oppression, and also suits the intelligentsia. In addition, the issue of succession to the throne will not be as acute as it was under the monarchy. Emperor Puyi's brother Pujie was elected president of the new republic."
     manchukou.6.a: "However, this will do little to change the internal politics of the state"
     
     manchukou.7.t: "Fate of the Imperial Throne"
     manchukou.7.d: "After the assassination of Emperor Puyi, the most important issue of Manchukuo's existence - its constitutional system - was raised again. In the early 30s, two options were considered: monarchy and republic. In the end, the first option won and Puyi became emperor, not president. But now, after his assassination, the republicans raised their heads again and proposed to switch to a republican form of government, which is more popular among the Chinese.\n\nDespite the fact that no heir had been chosen before Puyi's death, nothing prevents it from being done now, especially since there is a very convenient candidate in the person of the dead emperor's brother, Pujie. He has spent the last years of his military training in Japan, so he will be more inclined to work on the terms of the Kwantung Army."
     manchukou.7.a: "Long live Emperor Pujie!"
     manchukou.7.b: "No, we insist on a republic"
     
     manchukou.8.t: "Unsuccessful Assassination of the Emperor"
     manchukou.8.d: "Today, during Puyi's inspection of the new units of the Imperial Manchurian Army, an unpleasant incident occurred - a group of several soldiers from a newly formed unit opened fire on their emperor. A firefight broke out, during which several more people were injured, but the attackers were unable to fulfill their main task - Puyi was saved by soldiers of his personal guard, who covered him from the bullets. In the end, the assassins did not surrender alive.\n\nIt is assumed that this could happen because recruitment to the Manchu army is quite simple and enemy spies could easily infiltrate it. This is due to the need to form mass units to establish control over the entire territory of Manchukuo and suppress bandit formations."

Всё это произошло неподалёку от линии разграничения с китайскими армиями и некоторые части из них прибыли для поддержки своих восставших товарищей.

В ходе сражения китайскими офицерами было выяснено, что монголами командуют или по крайней мере помогают командовать японские наставники. В результате боя все они погибли. После того, как новость начала распространяться по Китаю, министр иностранных дел Японии сделал заявление, что это провокация недоброжелателей, желающих поссорить Китай и Японию друг с другом, так как в реальности никаких японских военных во Внутренней Монголии, а монголы занимаются командованием своей армии самостоятельно."

Для того, чтобы не вызвать какого-либо неприятного инцидента, так как эти офицеры-шпионы могли легко устроить бунт, то нам пришлось организовать специальную операцию по их задержанию, в ходе которой они были задержаны в безопасном месте и преданы полевому суду."

     manchukou.14.t: "Mongolian Governors' Meeting"
     manchukou.14.d: "A meeting of the governors of the four provinces of Xing'an was held today in Xinjing, the capital of Manchukuo. The most active speaker at this meeting was Lin Sheng, the head of northern Xing'an. Sheng criticized the Japanese Kwantung Army Command's “national policy” toward Manchukuo: he opposed Japan's immigration plan to send a group of colonists to the four Xing'an provinces from its interior; criticized the imposition of Japanese as the country's “national language”; opposed Japanese officials having real power over Mongolian governors; and opposed the division of eastern Inner Mongolia into four Xing'an provinces.\n\nBecause of the harsh words, the Japanese officials who presided over and ran the meeting were stunned and enraged. Of course, they did not and could not accept Lin Sheng's attacks on the established “national policy” of Manchukuo. Besides, Lin Sheng's various actions in the past had already aroused their discontent. So far, it is difficult to predict where such remarks by a sufficiently important state politician might lead."
     manchukou.14.a: "It's not worth paying attention to"
     manchukou.14.b: "We will move towards peace in Manchukuo."
     manchukou.14.c: "This is getting out of hand. Impose martial law on the Mongolian provinces."
     
     manchukou.15.t: "Arrests Begin in Xing'an"
     manchukou.15.d: "To prevent resistance from local forces, mostly subordinates of Lin Sheng and ethnic minorities in northern Xing'an Province, the Japanese military began imposing martial law in Hailar, Nantong, Sitong and Mohertu. Japanese spy agencies and military police arrested friends and subordinates of Lin Sheng - totaling more than 20 people, including even his relatives."
     manchukou.15.a: "Situation is escalating"
     
     manchukou.16.t: "Lin Sheng's Arrest"
     manchukou.16.d: "Ling Sheng returned to Hailar from Xinjing and, after getting off the bus, was arrested by the Japanese military police “for conspiracy to rebel” along with his secretary and Japanese translator Hua Lingtai. After his arrest, Lin Sheng and the others were brutally tortured at the Japanese gendarmerie headquarters in Hailar, but none of them confessed to the crimes listed by the Japanese, nor did they confess to any facts of “treason” or accuse others. During the torture, Lin Sheng took responsibility for all of them, saying: “Others are innocent, I am responsible for this alone, don't involve others.” He will now have to stand trial"
     manchukou.16.a: "Let's wait for the trial"
     
     manchukou.17.t: "Emperor's Request"
     manchukou.17.d: "Emperor Puyi learned of the incident with Lin Sheng. One of his younger sisters was engaged to Lin's son, so it turned out to be a very personal matter for the emperor. He asked Kenkichi Ueda, commander of the Kwantung Army, to help Lin Sheng in some way, to which Ueda informed him that the matter was settled because Lin had already been convicted by a Japanese military tribunal for “conspiracy to rebel.” Puyi was extremely saddened by this news, and in addition, he had to cancel his sister's marriage."
     manchukou.17.a: "Apparently, nothing can be changed"
     
     manchukou.18.t: "Execution"
     manchukou.18.d: "Lin Sheng and others were stripped of their medals. The Japanese Kwantung Army command sentenced Lin Sheng and the others to death. Before they were killed, their family members were called to a meeting at Xinjing Prison. At this moment, they knew they would be killed, but they were still strong. As they said their farewells, Ling Sheng knelt on the ground and bowed to his old father Guifu. In prison, Lin Sheng wrote a will of over 1,000 words in Manchu language that the Japanese had harmed him because of protecting local interests, which caused their displeasure and hatred."
     manchukou.18.a: "Sad end"
     
     manchukou.19.t: "Outcome of the Accident”
     manchukou.19.d: "After Lin Sheng and others were executed, the Japanese Kwantung Army Command developed and issued a secret manual that was distributed to “Japanese” officials in puppet Manchukuo with 30 articles. The first article of the manual states that “the Japanese nation is the nucleus of the various ethnic groups in Manchuria and the natural guide” and that “the status of the Japanese in Manchuria is not that of a stranger, but that of a master.” Mongol self-government in the east was finally abolished. “The Lin Sheng incident” caused a great shock among the officials of the ‘Manchurian faction’ of Manchukuo-Go, many sincerely interested in the success of this project received a dose of fear for their fate and lost any enthusiasm for the work."
     manchukou.19.a: "Now the pan-Asiatism and harmony of the five races has finally become an empty space"
     
     manchukou.20.t: "Manchurian Uprising"
     manchukou.20.d: "During Emperor Puyi's regular tour of the country to inspect Manchurian army units, the former Chinese bureaucracy, dissatisfied with the strengthening of the repressive apparatus and the loss of any levers of control over the country, decided to use this opportunity to revolt against their Japanese patrons. Puyi's departure to join his own troops from Xinjing, where he was under the almost constant control of the Japanese military, allowed the rebellion to happen and gave confidence to the Manchu armies, who killed Emperor Puyi's Japanese guards.\n\nThe too much political freedom that the Japanese gave to Manchukuo politicians, the creation of Manchukuo's own army, and the subsequent strengthening of the repressive apparatus led non-Japanese politicians to try to rebel. Only a few from among the cabinet and the emperor's entourage remained on the Japanese side. One of them was the powerless Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui, who from the very beginning had been in favor of a republican system in the state."
     manchukou.20.a: "We must defeat these traitors"
     manchukou.20.b: "It's time to break free from Japanese rule"
     
     manchukou.21.t: "Manchurian Uprising"
     manchukou.21.d: "Trouble does not come alone. A large-scale guerrilla uprising finally broke the stability of the political regime in Manchukuo and most of the non-Japanese bureaucratic staff decided to organize their own uprising against Japanese rule. It began during Emperor Puyi's visit to the Manchu troops to inspect their condition. This allowed the rebellion to happen and gave confidence to the Manchu armies, who killed Emperor Puyi's Japanese guards.\n\nThe too much political freedom that the Japanese gave to Manchukuo politicians, the creation of Manchukuo's own army, and the subsequent strengthening of the repressive apparatus led non-Japanese politicians to try to rebel. Only a few from among the cabinet and the emperor's entourage remained on the Japanese side. One of them was the powerless Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui, who from the very beginning had been in favor of a republican system in the state."
     
     manchukou.22.t: "Large-Scale Uprising in Manchukuo"
     manchukou.22.d: "The political experiment of the Kwantung Army, which began in Manchuria in the early 30s, led to its natural result - a large-scale uprising of Communist guerrillas, and after that - the collapse of the political regime itself, as almost the entire non-Japanese bureaucracy in alliance with the Manchurian army declared disobedience to the Kwantung Army and the Empire of Japan, after which it began its battles with Japanese soldiers. Emperor Puyi managed to deceive his troops before the rebellion began, thus retaining their leader."
     manchukou.22.a: "Military personnel in the Kwantung Army have failed their country again"
     manchukou.22.b: "We don't have the strength to take back Manchuria"
     
     manchukou.23.t: "Russians in Harbin"
     manchukou.23.d: "As is well known, Manchukuo is home to more than a hundred thousand Russian white emigrants who fled the Soviet regime. Among them, their own political movements began to form, which became especially popular after the arrival of the Kwantung Army on this land, as they financially supported various figures of emigration for their goals in the fight against the USSR. In addition, the lack of an enduring state authority led to the formation of several organized bandit groups divided ethnically (Russian, Korean, Chinese). Russian bandits began to work closely with the fascist parties established in Harbin in 1933, sometimes carrying out orders from the Kwantung Army and sometimes acting in their own personal interests. The Russian fascists, being influenced from Europe, veered heavily into anti-Semitism, blaming Jews for the death of Russia and other conspiracies, according to the so-called “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”."
     manchukou.23.a: "What about the Jews?"
     
     manchukou.24.t: "Case of Simon Caspe"
     manchukou.24.d: "Simon Caspe was the son of Joseph Caspe, the owner of the Hotel Moderne in Harbin, as well as most of the city's cinemas and theaters. He fled persecution from Russia and settled in Harbin in 1907, achieving French citizenship for himself and his family. His son, Simon, grew up in Harbin but studied for a time at the Paris Conservatory and was an accomplished pianist. During his summer vacation in August 1933, he was in Harbin and was returning in the evening from a walk with his girlfriend. He was accosted and kidnapped by an unknown group of persons. The next day his father received a note demanding a ransom of one hundred thousand dollars.\n\nJoseph Caspe contacted the French consul in Harbin, who delayed payment of the ransom, promising to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in the search for Simon. A month later, Caspe was sent half of his son's bloody ear. The consul again advised against paying the ransom. However, his son's body was found by the police on December 3, 1933. Simon Caspe was starved and beaten by his kidnappers, who cut off his ears, ripped out his fingernails and made him keep his head in a dark, cold pit underground when the temperature dropped to 30 degrees below zero. The kidnappers then killed him with a gunshot to the head."
     manchukou.24.a: "That's awful."
     
     manchukou.25.t: "Investigation"
     manchukou.25.d: "Thousands of people from many of Harbin's urban communities came to the funeral in protest. Almost everyone already knew about this story. It was clear to most people from the beginning who was behind this heinous crime - a gang of Russian fascists, protected by the Japanese police and the leaders of the Russian Fascist Party led by their leader Rodzaevsky. Under international pressure, the police had to arrest six suspects in Simon's murder. However, the first trial over them was delayed and ended in nothing - it was decided to hold a second trial, but the authorities began to delay its organization. Almost 2.5 years after the murder, it was time to put an end to this stupid case that was tarnishing the reputation of the entire Manchukuo project."
     manchukou.25.a: "Stand up, court is in session"
     
     manchukou.26.t: "Second Trial"
     manchukou.26.d: "The second trial of the six Russians charged with the brutal murder of Simon Caspe began today. The Japanese prosecutor immediately spoke in favor of the six defendants, calling them “Russian patriots who have raised the flag against the world danger - communism.” All this took place under the scrutiny of international journalists who had long been interested in this high-profile event, especially in light of attempts to gain international recognition for Manchukuo. It can be said that a lot depends on the fate of this case - the Japanese have established contacts with world Zionist leaders. The generals of the Kwantung Army wanted to give the Jews the opportunity, if not to establish their own state on the territory of Manchuria, then at least the possibility of free and peaceful settlement, taking into account the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. Against this background, to everyone's surprise, Chinese judges found guilty and sentenced the six Russian fascists who had tortured and killed Caspe to death."
     manchukou.26.a: "We have a chance to prove the integrity of our courts"
     
     manchukou.27.t: "Petition to the Emperor"
     manchukou.27.d: "The judges' admission of the Russian fascists' guilt and such a strict sentence created a bombshell effect: the Western media started talking about the integrity of the courts in Manchukuo, and some even spoke in favor of the possible recognition of this state. Inside Manchukuo, however, it caused a great deal of resentment on the part of some Japanese military officers, as well as Russian fascist leaders, because the Russian Fascist Party called the six defendants “martyrs for Holy Rus” and presented Puyi with a petition with thousands of signatures asking for their pardon."
     manchukou.27.a: "Puyi takes the petition, but disagrees to grant clemency to the killers"
     
     manchukou.28.t: "Execution of Murderers"
     manchukou.28.d: "After the emperor refused the Russian fascist leader Rodzaevsky a pardon for his subordinates, as well as a personal audience for negotiations, he decided to appeal to the Supreme Court of Shinkin, where all judges are under the control of the military from the Kwantung Army. However, even this did not help the chief - the judges rejected the appeal and confirmed the death sentence for the six defendants. A few days later it was carried out in Harbin City Prison, where the prisoners were held. The Jewish community greeted the decision of the state authorities with jubilation, after which many Jews who had left Manchukuo in two years announced their imminent return. International experts now predict the possible recognition of the state by some of the Great Powers, such as the United States, Great Britain or France."
     manchukou.28.a: "Sad story with a good ending"
     
     manchukou.29.t: "Supreme Court Decision"
     manchukou.29.d: "After the emperor refused the Russian fascist leader Rodzaevsky a pardon for his subordinates, as well as a personal audience for negotiations, he decided to appeal to the Supreme Court of Shinkin, where all the judges are under the control of the military from the Kwantung Army. And this changed the course of the case - the judges accepted the appeal and overturned the death sentence for the six defendants imposed by the court in Harbin. This decision was received with resentment by the Emperor, but he did not obstruct it. After this, many Jews living in Manchukuo confirmed their desire to leave that state, which undermined all Japanese plans to establish Jewish autonomy on its territory. Also now most of the international journalists who spread the news around the world recognize that the reputation of this state entity in Manchuria has fallen even lower than it was, and the chances of recognition have diminished."
     manchukou.29.a: "Japanese shot oneself in the foot"
     
     manchukou.30.t: "Sandō's Death"
     manchukou.30.d: "One of the representatives of the Mongolian nobility, Prince Sandō, one of the oldest politicians in Manchukuo, who was appointed the last head of Outer Mongolia under the Qing Empire, passed away. This fact was partly responsible for its rejection into the Russian sphere of influence. After the Imperial Japanese Army troops entered the territory of Manchuria, he agreed to cooperate with the new regime, as the Japanese abolished the oppression of Mongols in the territory of his banner."
     manchukou.30.a: "Goodbye"
     
     manchukou.31.t: "Final Suppression of the Partisans"
     manchukou.31.d: "We have succeeded in dealing with the massive partisan movement in Manchukuo, which was sponsored and supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Now nothing will threaten the civilian infrastructure, industry and colonists settling the vast territories of our nation."
     manchukou.31.a: "That should attract more investment"
     
     manchukou.32.t: "Large-Scale Bandit Uprising"
     manchukou.32.d: "We have not been able to stop the rise in popularity of the Communists. As a consequence, the number of Communist guerrilla units in Manchukuo territory has increased. We will now have to put aside all other matters and deal with the suppression of the civil uprising which directly threatens our rule in the territory of northeastern China."
     manchukou.32.a: "This should not have been allowed"
     manchukou.32.b: "It's time to liberate Manchuria from the insurgents!"
     
     manchukou.33.t: "Death of YCP Leader"
     manchukou.33.d: "The leader of the Young China Party, Zeng Qi, died today after a long illness. He had led the party almost uninterruptedly since its founding, and during that time he had managed to gain a foothold in Chinese politics with minimal power. In the end, he was able to unite with our monarchist government, after which the Young Chinese and the monarchists together began the journey to build a new China."
     manchukou.33.a: "A great loss to the country"
     
     manchukou.34.t: "Death of Prime Minister"
     manchukou.34.d: "The leader of the Young China Party, Zeng Qi, died today after a long illness. He had led the party almost uninterruptedly since its founding, and during that time he had managed to gain a foothold in Chinese politics with minimal power. In the end, he was able to unite with our monarchist government, after which the Young Chinese and the monarchists together began the journey to build a new China. As he was prime minister, the Young China Party must now choose a new leader to continue Zeng's work."
     manchukou.34.a: "Li Huang will take the reigns"
     manchukou.34.b: "Shunsheng Zuo will lead the party"
     
     manchukou.35.t: "Governor Resigns"
     manchukou.35.d: "Liu Mengen, Governor of Jehol Province, has resigned from his post. This was his personal request due to health reasons. He was an important politician in the country's governance system, known to ordinary people, soldiers and officials since the Zhili clique was in power in the Republic of China, of which he was a member."
     manchukou.35.a: "Let's hope he returns"
     
     manchukou.36.t: "Luo Zhenyu Retires"
     manchukou.36.d: "One of the founders of Manchukuo, a famous Chinese monarchist and scholar, Luo Zhengyu, resigned his posts and retired. He had long been involved in the political life of the country, having been a close friend and adviser to Emperor Puyi since 1919. It was largely due to his position and actions that Manchukuo became a monarchy rather than the republic which many other politicians favoured in the early 30s. However, he became disillusioned with the fact that most of the levers of power were in the hands of the military from the Kwantung Army and decided to devote the rest of his life to academia."
     manchukou.36.a: "We will manage without him"
     
     manchukou.37.t: "Sasaki Tōichi Leaves"
     manchukou.37.d: "Sasaki Tōichi, the man who had spent all these years trying to turn Manchukuo into a beautiful country of the future that would show the world the unity and greatness of the Asian peoples, could no longer stand the conditions imposed by the Kwantung Army. He reported that he viewed the Mukden incident as a 'revolution' that had liberated the people of Manchuria from 'feudal' rule and as an attempt to establish a modern 'moral state' based on multi-ethnic harmony. On his arrival in Manchuria, however, Sasaki was disappointed. During his time as a military adviser, he repeatedly advised Japanese officers to rid themselves of their 'sense of superiority' over the Chinese. He noted that five years after its establishment Manchukuo-Go had not become an 'independent state' and that continuing to refer to it as such was nothing but 'self-deception'. He also noted that the Manchurian army was not united by any noble national ideal, but by a comprehensive system of punishment and reward."
     manchukou.37.a: "We can't deal with it"
     
     manchukou.38.t: "No Heir"
     manchukou.38.d: "When it came to the question of what kind of state system Manchukuo should have, one of the arguments put forward by the supporters of the republic was the problem of succession to the throne, since Emperor Puyi had no children. The monarchists were able to persuade their rivals by promising to resolve the issue of succession in the future.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this problem. The first is to declare Puyi's brother Pujie, who is studying at a military academy in Japan, as the heir to the Manchurian throne. This is the most logical option, but the Emperor himself does not like it because of his resentment and distrust of his brother. As an alternative, he personally sees his distant relative Yuyan, who has recently arrived and is now living with him in Xinjing, and with whom he has become very close during this time."
     manchukou.38.a: "Pujie is the only adequate choice"
     manchukou.38.b: "Let's take a risk and choose Yuyan"
     
     manchukou.39.t: "No True Heir"
     manchukou.39.d: "Despite the selection of Pujie as the presumptive heir, long-standing Manchu tradition has always required the emperor to choose a person from the next generation as heir, and therefore Pujie has no rights to the throne. Now that the 'presumptive' heir has been chosen, the Japanese will surely wish to marry his brother to a suitable candidate, such as a Japanese aristocrat or member of the Japanese Imperial House, to infuse the Manchu bloodline. As he is now being educated in Japan, he will be exposed to as much Japanese agitation as possible.\n\nIn fact, Pujie had a wife. The Emperor's brother married a Manchurian noblewoman Tang Shixia in 1924, but the relationship did not go well, as the marriage was more of a convenience. In 1926, Tang became the mistress of 'Young Marshal' Zhang Xueliang and broke off relations with Pujie and his family. As a result, he never had any children. Speaking of Tang Shixia, she is now known to be dating another Chinese playboy, Lu Xiaojia, son of General Lu Yongxiang, a prominent member of the Anhui clique. Together with Zhang Xueliang, Sun Fo, son of Sun Yat-sen, and Duan Hongye, son of Duan Qirui, they make up the so-called 'Four Sons of the Republic of China', the second generation of military leaders."
     manchukou.39.a: "So what about the heir to the throne?"
     
     manchukou.40.t: "Puyi's Plan"
     manchukou.40.d: "However, Puyi has a plan to stop Japanese interference in the Manchu imperial clan: he will try to marry his brother to one of the Manchu nobles. He has in mind his cousin, one of the most beautiful girls in the Aisin-Gioro clan, Wang Mintong. Long ago, she herself was one of the candidates for his wife, but Emperor chose Wanrong. Now he invites her to come urgently to Xinjing to meet Pujie, to whom Puyi has also written a letter asking her to meet him in Manchukuo as soon as possible."
     manchukou.40.a: "The Emperor's chances are slim, but they are there"
     
     manchukou.41.t: "Tang Shixia Scandal"
     manchukou.41.d: "During the Emperor's trial with his brother and his marriage, an unpleasant fact came to light. It turned out that his first wife, Tang Shixia, had not only become the mistress of another Chinese military leader, but had also begun to steal jewellery from Pujie's house in Peking, to which she still had access after their divorce. Apparently it was her new boyfriend, Lu Xiaojia, who put her up to it. Pujie himself had no way of knowing what was going on, as he had been training in Japan for the past few years. Puyi decided to tell him the story in person."
     manchukou.41.a: "She is a disgrace to the Aisin-Gioro clan"
     
     manchukou.42.t: "Manchukuo's Heir"
     manchukou.42.d: "Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo has no heirs and is unlikely to produce any. He is also rather stubborn and unlikely to agree to marry a candidate we favour. This raises the question of succession. So far, his brother Pujie has been chosen as the 'presumptive heir', but old Manchu tradition has always required the emperor to choose a person from the next generation as heir, so he has no right to the throne. However, Pujie is currently divorced from his first wife, with whom he had an unhappy relationship, and has no children from that marriage. This opens up great opportunities for us, as we can offer him a marriage to a representative of the Japanese aristocracy or even a member of the Imperial House, thanks to which their descendants of Japanese blood will be able to become Emperors of Manchukuo. Now that he is in Japan for training, he is exposed to our agitation as much as possible."
     manchukou.42.a: "We need to select a suitable candidate"
     
     manchukou.43.t: "Puyi's Intervention"
     manchukou.43.d: "Emperor Puyi of Manchukuo is trying to interfere with our plan to marry his brother to our candidate. He urgently invited his cousin Wang Mintong and his mother to Xinjing and wrote a letter to his brother Pujie asking him to return to Manchukuo immediately after completing his studies at the Tokyo Military Academy."
     manchukou.43.a: "We must stop this activity immediately"
     manchukou.43.b: "Perhaps by leaving Pujie alone, Puyi will become more cooperative with us"
     
     manchukou.44.t: "Plans Destroyed"
     manchukou.44.d: "When the Japanese military in the Kwantung Army learned of the Emperor's plan to marry his brother to a girl from the Aisin-Gioro clan, they were so displeased that they demanded that Wang Mingtong and her mother return home from Xinjing, and the Emperor's brother Pujie was apparently never informed of the planned marriage. They seem to have plans of their own for his marriage."
     manchukou.44.a: "That's despicable"
     
     manchukou.45.t: "Candidates for Pujie"
     manchukou.45.d: "Pujie had a good relationship with General Shigeru Honjō, a supporter of the Imperial Way Faction and one of the main instigators of the Mukden Incident in 1931. Over the past few days, he had hurriedly picked up several Japanese women of his choice for the Manchukuo Emperor's brother. Today he showed their pictures at a meeting with Pujie. After careful consideration, he chose Hiro Saga, daughter of Marquis Saneto Saga and a distant relative of Emperor Hirohito."
     manchukou.45.a: "It's a good choice"

     manchukou.46.t: "Pujie's Engagement"
     manchukou.46.d: "The engagement of Pujie, the younger brother of Emperor Puyi, to Hiro Saga, the daughter of a Japanese marquis and distant relative of Emperor Hirohito, was held today at the Manchukuo embassy in Tokyo. Pujie had just graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, so the ceremony was attended by numerous Japanese military officials, along with journalists and the bride's family. Interestingly, Pujie had not informed his brother about the engagement beforehand, which meant Emperor Puyi was unable to attend."
     manchukou.46.a: "This is a betrayal"
     manchukou.46.b: "Our plan does work"

     manchukou.47.t: "Pujie and Hiro Saga's Wedding"
     manchukou.47.d: "After Pujie and Hiro Saga got engaged, a grand wedding was held at the Imperial Army Hall in Tokyo. The event drew a large crowd of distinguished guests, but Pujie's brother, Emperor Puyi, refused to attend. It is widely believed that Puyi had become distant towards his brother after learning that Pujie had secretly decided to marry a Japanese woman without informing him."
     manchukou.47.a: "This gap between the two has been apparent for a few years now"
     manchukou.47.b: "Puyi should accept his brother as he is"

     manchukou.48.t: "Return of Pujie"
     manchukou.48.d: "After spending several years training in Japan, Pujie returned to Manchukuo, this time accompanied by his new wife, Hiro Saga. They settled in Xinjing, the capital, close to Emperor Puyi’s palace. However, the relationship between the brothers quickly deteriorated after Pujie's marriage. Puyi saw it as a personal betrayal and grew suspicious of Hiro, believing she might be a Japanese spy. At their first dinner together, Puyi refused to eat the food Hiro had served him, and he rarely had the open, candid discussions with his brother that they once shared about important matters."
     manchukou.48.a: "Puyi is increasingly closing himself off from the outside world"

     manchukou.49.t: "Warming Relationship"
     manchukou.49.d: "Puyi had recently become quite secretive, avoiding open conversations in front of his brother. He even refused to eat any food prepared by Hiro Saga, suspecting she might be trying to poison him. Puyi was also pressured into signing an agreement that, if he had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised there. Over time, however, his relationship with Hiro began to improve, as she consistently reassured him that her intentions were sincere—that she had come to Xinjing as his brother’s wife, not as a spy. The mistrust between them finally dissolved when Hiro chose to abandon her Japanese kimono in favor of a Chinese qipao. She then took steps to mend Puyi’s relationship with Empress Wanrong, even arranging for them to dine together for the first time in three years."
     manchukou.49.a: "Perhaps Hiro Saga is indeed a kind and sincere woman"

     manchukou.50.t: "Plan Worked"
     manchukou.50.d: "Puyi successfully countered the intrigues of the Japanese military, although he had to recognize that this was ultimately due to the decisions and desires of the Japanese themselves. When Pujie arrived in Xinjing, he was greeted not only by his brother but also by his cousin Wang Mintong and their mother. The banquet at the imperial palace was organized by Wang, who was a skilled hostess and an excellent cook. Pujie and Wang sat side by side, engaging in quiet conversation despite having only recently gotten to know each other. The lively atmosphere of the banquet lifted Puyi’s spirits, which had been low for the past few months; he drank heavily and entertained the guests with jokes. His jovial demeanor was likely a reflection of his relief that his plan was working and that he could finally thwart the Japanese influence."
     manchukou.50.a: "A Japanese, a Russian and a German walk into a..."

     manchukou.51.t: "Pujie and Wang Mingtong's Wedding"
     manchukou.51.d: "The wedding of Pujie, Emperor's brother, and Manchurian aristocrat Wang Mingtong, who is his close relative, took place today in Xinjing. Despite the circumstances, both the bride and groom seemed happy with each other. Many people who had previously been barred from entering the capital of Manchukuo were also able to attend the celebration."
     manchukou.51.a: "This gives us confidence in the country's future"

     manchukou.52.t: "Resettlement of Korean Group"
     manchukou.52.d: "The programme for the resettlement of poor Korean peasants in Manchukuo launched jointly by our government and the Japanese government is being carried out. The Xinjing office is working on the programme, while the Seoul office is collecting information and offering the scheme to the Koreans."
     manchukou.52.a: "The plan is working"

     manchukou.53.t: "The Fugu Plan"
     manchukou.53.d: "A group of Kwantung Army officers, known as the 'Manchurian faction', promoted the idea of working closely with international Jewish leaders to attract Jewish migrants to Manchukuo, where they could be provided with comfortable living conditions. The present situation in Europe and increased anti-Semitism have caused another wave of emigration, and in Palestine the British authorities have created difficult conditions for Jews to obtain citizenship. We should seize this opportunity to improve our international reputation by giving Jews a new home in Manchuria. Moreover, there is a large Jewish lobby in the United States, and with its help we can try to persuade the United States to recognise our supremacy in the Asian region. These are the ideas of the Manchurian faction of the military."
     manchukou.53.a: "They can take control of the issue"
     manchukou.53.b: "Jews can migrate to the sphere under our control if they want to"
     manchukou.53.c: "We don't care about Jewish problems"

     manchukou.54.t: "Jewish Question under Military Control"
     manchukou.54.d: "Tokyo gave the Kwantung Army complete freedom of action on the Jewish question. In this way we can begin to implement various Zionist projects by contacting international Jewish leaders and their organisations."
     manchukou.54.a: "Great news"

     manchukou.55.t: "Tokyo Takes Jewish Question under Its Control"
     manchukou.55.d: "The politicians in Tokyo agreed that Jews could be useful to the Empire of Japan, but we should not go too far into the matter, lest we spend the resources needed for warfare on a rather adventurous project that has a chance of not materialising. Of course, if the Jews themselves wish to immigrate to the territories under our control, that is to be welcomed, but nothing more."
     manchukou.55.a: "Half measures really won't succeed"

     manchukou.56.t: "Japan Doesn't Want Jews"
     manchukou.56.d: "Politicians in Tokyo decided that the Jewish question did not concern Japan enough to give it any significant influence. The attitude towards the emigrating Jewish population should be the same as towards other peoples."
     manchukou.56.a: "They're missing a big opportunity"

     manchukou.57.t: "Location of Jewish State"
     manchukou.57.desc: "The territory of Manchukuo is large enough to allow us to choose a suitable location for the proposed Jewish state. One option is the former Chinese province of Jehol, which would create a 'buffer' zone between us and the Chinese territories. Another viable choice is the modern province of Xing'an, which has a partially Mongolian population but a weak Mongolian aristocracy. This could help us align the interests of the Mongols with those of the Jews, preventing any thoughts of secession in favor of Mongolian states. We could also consider the Liaodong Peninsula and the city of Mukden, which would help balance the Manchu population and aristocracy in those areas. Lastly, we should explore land in the USSR, where the so-called Jewish Autonomous Oblast was established as a Bolshevik project to create a Jewish state. Since there is already a Jewish population there, we could facilitate their reunification while also displacing the Russians, assuming we can maintain control of the region."
     manchukou.57.a: "Let's choose the land of Jehol"
     manchukou.57.b: "Let's choose the land of Xing'an"
     manchukou.57.c: "Let's choose the land of Liaodong"
     manchukou.57.d: "Let's choose the land of Birobidzhan"

     manchukou.58.t: "Proclamation of Yisrael"
     manchukou.58.d: "Today, on the land of our choice, representatives of the Jewish communities of Harbin, Tokyo and other Asian cities proclaimed the establishment of their own state, which will be a great holiday for the Jewish people who were deprived of it many millennia ago and wandered the globe in search of a home. Only the great empire of Japan was able to offer them such a home."
     manchukou.58.a: "Jews are Asians after all"
     manchukou.58.b: "Long live Yisrael!"

     manchukou.59.t: "Dissemination of monarchist propaganda"
     manchukou.59.d: "The revolt of the Manchuria clan led by Emperor Puyi against the Japanese rulers triggered a new wave of patriotic anti-Japanese movement. Many of the latent monarchists who remained in Chinese society became active, thus beginning a new rise in the popularity of the monarchy, which seemed to have died after the last two pathetic attempts at restorations."
     manchukou.59.a: "It can't threaten our power"

     manchukou.60.t: "Promise to the peasants"
     manchukou.60.d: "Our government issued an appeal to the peasants to join the Manchurian army for the sake of universal resistance to the invaders. In exchange, the government pledged to initiate long-awaited land reform after defeating the Japanese. But we should not delay its fulfilment after the victory over the Japanese - after some time the mood of the peasants will change and they may revolt against us after being exposed to communist propaganda."
     manchukou.60.a: "Sneaky action"

     manchukou.61.t: "Chinese emigration propaganda"
     manchukou.61.d: "The revolt of the Manchuria clan led by Emperor Puyi against their Japanese overlords sparked a new wave of patriotic anti-Japanese movement throughout China. Many of the latent monarchists who remained in Chinese society began to raise up, thus beginning a new rise in the popularity of the monarchy, which seemed to have died after the last two pathetic attempts at restorations. The leaders of the existing Chinese community in our country also began to try to get help for their rebellious comrades in Manchuria."
     manchukou.61.a: "Apart from moral support, there is little we can do to help them"

     manchukou.62.t: "Manchurians offer co-operation"
     manchukou.62.d: "The Manchurian Imperial Court with its army rebelling against the Japanese invaders in the person of the Kwantung Army proposes to organise cooperation against common enemies, as in the current situation only unification and a united anti-Japanese front can save the country. In this way, we may be setting a good example for all other Chinese politicians. After the war, the monarchists intend to establish a constitutional regime where the Young China Party will be able to come to power in a completely legal way, without relying on the militarists' methods of force."
     manchukou.62.a: "We agree"
     manchukou.62.b: "We're not ready to join the monarchists"

     manchukou.63.t: "The Ironblood Army has joined us"
     manchukou.63.d: "The leaders of the Ironblood Army have agreed to join our government in the fight against the Japanese invaders. Their generals and troops are now subject to us, but once the war is over, we will have to take their political views into account when forming the state structure."
     manchukou.63.a: "Greate news"

     manchukou.64.t: "The Ironblood Army's Refusal"
     manchukou.64.d: "The Ironblood Army leaders refused the offer to join our government in fighting the Japanese invaders. They will also continue to fight them, but we will act independently of each other."
     manchukou.64.a: "Neither fish nor fowl"

     manchukou.65.t: "Return to Mukden"
     manchukou.65.d: "After a hard-fought war of independence, the imperial court finally returns to the true Manchuria capital, the city of Mukden, as Puyi had dreamed of for so long. He always had trouble tolerating Xinjing, where the Japanese tried to lock him up. The town was artificial, built from a small village early in this century. The Japanese clearly showed who was more important in Manchukuo-Go - the Kwantung Army General Staff building was several times larger than the Emperor's palace. Now, at last, Puyi will finally be able to realise his next dream of becoming emperor of all of China once again by conquering it, repeating the success of his ancestors.\n\nHowever, during the liberation period, several factions have formed in our independent government that will try to push their vision of a future monarchy through. They may be so strong that Puyi will be their puppet again."

     manchukou.68.t: "Peasant uprising"
     manchukou.68.d: "Delaying agrarian reform for too long led to growing peasant discontent and the spread of communist ideas among them. CCP agents infiltrated their ranks, smuggled weapons into the territory under our control, and conducted propaganda among some of our army, after which they started an uprising in several regions."

     manchukou.69.d: "Manchuria is once again entering a difficult period of political reform, which it needs. Puyi and the rest of the court are already familiar with this from the events of the early 30s when Manchukuo-Go was being formed, but then the Japanese military, now gone, also played a huge role. However, that doesn't mean there isn't a big fight going on within the government apparatus over what Manchuria and possibly all of China will be like. In order to resolve these issues, the temporary martial law imposed during the confrontation with the Kwantung Army must be lifted."
     manchukou.69.a: "A period of political turbulence is beginning"

     manchukou.70.t: "Dangerous alleys of Mukden"
     manchukou.70.d: "Chinese Youth Party leader Zeng Qi was assassinated in Mukden today while travelling from the imperial palace to his hotel where he is temporarily staying. His car was fired upon by several unknown men in a not very crowded alley in the city, after which they immediately fled the scene. Along with the politician, his driver was killed and the car hit the wall of the house due to loss of control.\n\nThis shocking incident has already raised a number of questions, as it occurred just before the emperor suggested that the politician put forward the Young Chinese draft constitution as the main option. The assassination was clearly planned by opponents of the Chinese Youth Party, as without their main leader they will lose their already low level of support."
     manchukou.70.a: "The police should be assigned to investigate the crime"
     manchukou.70.b: "Military counterintelligence will handle this extraordinary case"

     manchukou.71.t: "Results of the investigation"
     manchukou.71.d: "Our newly formed police force has taken up the investigation into the murder of the Chinese Youth leader, uncovering many inconvenient facts, the official publication of which will lead to strong political changes. A report by the chief of the Mukden Police Department said that the assassins of Zeng Qi were linked to the army's top officers, who were totally dissatisfied with the Young China Party's vision of China."
     manchukou.71.a: "Let's publish the results of the investigation"

     manchukou.72.t: "Military demands martial law"
     manchukou.72.d: "The military counter-intelligence conducted its own investigation into the murder of Zeng Qi and found that the situation is very grave - the assassins were linked to the Kuomintang, probably their spy network has penetrated very deeply into our government, causing the military to request permission to return martial law to deal with Republican agents, of which there are many in our government."
     manchukou.72.a: "They could impose martial law"
     manchukou.72.b: "Martial law is not required"

     manchukou.73.t: "Dissatisfaction Chinese Youth Party"
     manchukou.73.d: "After word began to spread among the political elite that the monarch was leaning toward the option of restoring the Manchukuo Constitution written by the Japanese, many members of the Young-Chinese Party immediately opposed it. This is a very sensitive issue that resonates with the general public as well, so the Young Chinese can take advantage of this situation to gain popularity and influence the situation in their favour."
     manchukou.73.a: "The military must take control of the case"
     manchukou.73.b: "Let the outrage continue"
     manchukou.73.c: "Let's give up on that idea"

     manchukou.74.t: "Street collisions"
     manchukou.74.d: "As we had anticipated, the Chinese Young, having failed to obtain a reversal of our decision, began to work among the common people, intellectuals and students, taking them to demonstrations and demanding the abolition of the Japanese constitution of Manchukuo-Go. There have already been several clashes with the military that have resulted in several deaths. A message was passed to the leaders of the ITUC that if they do not stop these provocations, we will have to go to «extreme measures»."
     manchukou.74.a: "The situation is escalating"

     manchukou.75.t: "The arrest of the leaders of the CYP"
     manchukou.75.d: "Unfortunately, our co-operation with the China Young Party came to an end - its leaders did not want to work with us and staged several provocations, in response to which we had to arrest some of the leaders of the YCP. Somebody managed to warn their top brass, thanks to which they managed to escape from the soldiers of our army."

     manchukou.76.t_b: "Mutiny in the army"
     manchukou.76.d: "Our attempt to crack down hard on people's protests and arrest the leaders of the CYP led to strong opposition from parts of the military, political and bureaucratic circles. The ill-considered action pushed the government into another serious split - the Chinese Young announced the establishment of their own government, after which a part of our army and some governors came over to their side."
     manchukou.76.d_a: "Emperor Puyi, forcibly abdicated, wielded enormous powers. However, with each passing day of the Xinhai Revolution, fewer and fewer people were willing to obey orders from Beijing, so it was decided to abdicate the throne for the minor emperor. Since then, he was first isolated in the Forbidden City for a time and later banished from there. All these years he had been hatching plans to regain his rightful power, so it was impossible for him not to take advantage of his high popularity in society after the expulsion of the Japanese - the emperor tried to restore the system of the heavenly mandate instead of the constitution.\n\nOnce information about this began to spread among the elites, it could not but reach the members of the Chinese Young Party, which was in coalition with the monarchists. Such a drastic change in the government's course was not to their liking. Together with loyal parts of the army, they revolted in parts of the controlled territories, announcing their own republican government."
     manchukou.76.d_b: "During our preparations for the restoration of Manchuria as an independent state, we missed the fact that in our army there is a faction of officers who came to us from the Ironblood Army, and therefore share the views of politicians from the Chinese Young Party, who naturally do not want to hear anything about our idea, as they have been fighting against Manchukuo since 1934. Today, these elements with loyalist soldiers have mutinied in the army, proclaiming the re-establishment of the Ironblood Army."
     manchukou.76.a: "We need to finish these traitors off"
     manchukou.76.b: "No more Manchu tyranny!"

     manchukou.77.t: "The Chinese Young are Taking Over"
     manchukou.77.d: "The Emperor's attempt to return to the Manchukuo-Go constitution did not find favour with his entourage. Much of the military top brass proved amenable to the democratic ideas of the China Young Party, and the effective mobilisation of the common people, students and intellectuals persuaded the rest of the government to move to the demands of the protesters. The emperor has no choice but to accept the demands and adopt either the Chinese Young draft constitution or a compromise version created by a group of reformers at the imperial court."

The assassin pulled out a pistol and fired several times from an arm's length away, leaving Puyi with no chance of survival. The assassin was caught immediately and has already been sent to prison to await trial.\n\nNow the draft constitution is being delayed because of the need to hold a ceremony to enthrone the new monarch, who will be Pujie, the Emperor's brother. Some believe that this will allow the imperial court and close politicians to push for a more favourable draft constitution, as Puyi himself has been pushing for more powers."

     manchukou.80.d: "Because of the mourning for the murdered monarch, the ceremony of the new Emperor Pujie's accession to the throne was not extremely lavish, but rather modest. However, the main question on many people's minds was whether the new monarch was interested in expanding his constitutional powers. When Pujie said in his speech that he would not actively interfere in political processes, most of his entourage breathed a sigh of relief. The choice of a new constitution now rests on their shoulders. The more reactionary among them are proposing to retain the Manchukuo Basic Law, while a group of reformers are proposing a more liberal version of the constitution in which the powers of the monarch will be further curtailed and the parliament will play the main role."

However, when prison guards opened his cell in the morning, they found that the murderer had hanged himself during the night with a thin rope that he had apparently brought with him. Sadly, we will never know his motives, nor will we be able to enforce legal punishment."

Since then, he has been isolated for a time in the Forbidden City, and later banished from it. All these years he had been hatching plans to regain his rightful power, so he could not fail to take advantage of the high popularity in society after the expulsion of the Japanese - the Emperor tried to restore the system of the Heavenly Mandate instead of the Constitution.\n\nAs soon as the news spread among the elites, it immediately caused discontent among the majority of them, because the Manchurian aristocracy, military and politicians had tasted power in the previous decades and did not want to lose it. They were also aware of the hatred that would be aroused among the common people - the complete abolition of democracy and a return to pre-revolutionary principles. In this context, a general conspiracy against the Emperor and his few supporters was quickly formed. A few days before the announcement of the restoration of absolutism, the emperor was again isolated in his palace and a constitutional assembly was urgently convened to choose a draft constitution: either the preservation of a Manchukuo-like system or a draft constitution that would further restrict the monarch."

They did not like such a drastic change in the government's policy. Moreover, Puyi's attempt to get rid of old, inconvenient generals led to the rise in the army of young Young Chinese commanders, who were also very popular among subordinates and ordinary people as 'ger guerrillas'. Now the days, or rather the hours, of the project to restore the Heavenly Mandate were counted."

He is not ready to relinquish power peacefully, clearly hoping for help from 'outside', but the streets of Mukden are empty at this point, no one really understands what is going on as the conspirators have taken care to disrupt communications and take over the entire infrastructure. However, this cannot go on indefinitely and we need to decide what political steps to take next. Many members of the Young Chinese Party have the idea of abandoning the monarchy and establishing a republican regime, but it should be realised that the monarch's popularity is still quite high, so abandoning the monarchy will have very serious consequences for the legitimacy of our government."

They did not like such a drastic change in the government's policy. As a result, a conspiracy has formed among them to try to stop the Emperor from this mad move, which will once again undermine the monarchical government. This morning, a small number of army units loyal to the Young Chinese marched into the capital, but the retention of old Manchu generals in the army meant that things went wrong for the conspirators from the start. Bloodshed was avoided thanks to the weakness of the YCP leaders - after learning of their small numbers, they fled the capital, leaving the retreating soldiers without orders. After some time, they were brought to their senses and forced to retreat to their barracks without a fight."

We can set up an incomplete parliament for now, holding elections only in the areas we control. Or we can invite some well-known personalities from the remaining areas to join our parliament as representatives of their respective provinces.

During these years, bandits and criminals were able to gain strength and almost form a local mafia. This mafia was ethnically diverse and was deliberately encouraged by the Japanese. To this day, Manchuria is inundated with Chinese, Russian, Korean and Mongolian bandits. It would be difficult to fight them all at once, but instead we could ally ourselves with one of the criminal groups to eliminate the others."

Our plan is coming to fruition, as the bandits are now too preoccupied with their own survival to carry out their usual robberies. The leaders can't even work out which of the groups started the fight, as it was only necessary to break the status quo and destroy their usual divided 'zones of influence'. The criminal structures are not only weakened by the loss of trust in each other, but are also shrinking physically as a result of the deaths of members of criminal communities and gangs."

They have been weakened by the constant firefights with other gangsters, and their best fighters are either out or badly wounded. So we have a risky opportunity ahead of us - to try and crush this last single group on our own, without fulfilling our obligation to integrate them into the power structure of the state."

So they have now approached our government with a proposal for the return of Japanese-owned assets in northeast China. This includes the assets of two major corporations: Mitsubishi and Mantetsu, as well as other small companies. In addition, they are willing to restore other trade relations between our countries, but they will not agree to the redeployment of any Japanese contingents on the territory of Manchuria."

People took to the streets and organised rallies and demonstrations. Their main slogan was 'What did we fight for?' There are suspicions that such actions could not have been organised so quickly without the support of someone.

Xi Qia, as the head of the government and representative of the Aisin-Gioro clan, began preparations to proclaim an independent Manchurian state on the basis of our government. Such a turnaround was totally incomprehensible to most of the government, officials, the military and Emperor Puyi himself. Xi Qia had no chance because of the small number of his supporters. At a government meeting, under threat of assassination, he was forced to resign. By personal decree, the emperor removed him from the active ranks of the army."

Once all the proper people were inside the Legislative Assembly building, Xi Qia took the floor and proclaimed the restoration of the state of Manchuria as a monarchy headed by Puyi. His words were followed first by an awkward silence and then by a small applause from his supporters. Our government now had no claim to the rest of China and was beginning to pursue an independent policy apart from the legitimacy it derived from Manchukuo. It cannot be overlooked that Xi had made a bold but ill-considered move, and most of his actions only undermined the credibility of our government."

The Manchu aristocracy, embodying the designs of 30 years ago, does not realize that the dream of a separate country in the northeast will be shattered by the defiance of the predominant Han Chinese population as well as by the advancing army of any Chinese government."

So the question of what language to use in a country is often crucial to people's self-determination. But in Manchuria the problem is not so easy to solve because the Manchu ethnic group has its own language, but probably less than five per cent of the people know it. In this respect we should probably maintain the use of Chinese, at least temporarily."

However, they managed to form their own army in Manchuria and, in coalition with the monarchists, launched an uprising that drove out the Japanese invaders. This boosted the credibility of the monarchist idea in the country, and their alliance with the democratically minded YCP helped them gain a lot of credibility with the people.\n\nAll this makes it possible for our province to join the new government, which is gradually fighting the republicans throughout the country and is likely to prevail, without bloodshed.

But many smaller parties also contested the election: a splinter group of the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the State Socialist Party and the federalist China Zhi Gong Party.

They advocated democratic socialism and, against the 'right-wing' Young China Party, greater social guarantees and state control of the economy. This platform has won them the trust of the Chinese electorate, as our country remains quite poor and very diverse in terms of financial stratification."

For a long time this resistance had a partisan character: the communist anti-Japanese units were scattered and acted independently. In February 1936 we began to prepare to unite our forces: the leaders of the armies, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Zhou Baozhong, Zhao Shangzhi and Wang Datay, signed a declaration of the United Organisation of the Northeast Counter-Japanese United Army. This helped to strengthen our resistance to the Japanese, culminating in the present great uprising. We should emphasise this new success by taking the next organisational step of setting up our own government in the areas under our control to lead a peaceful life and build a new society."

Of course, we should not think that this will hinder our efforts, but it will partially obstruct the promotion of the 'Nisen Ittai' policy."

This decision is made at the insistence of the Kwantung Army Special Services Bureau, which remains in Manchukuo for the time being, but it is believed to be one of his last instructions from the Manchurian government. There are two main candidates: Kaisaku Ozawa, leader of the left-wing bureaucrats and founder of the Concordia Association, and Tachibana Shiraki, a well-known journalist and sociologist who is also a close friend of the Manchurian military faction.[GetEventAdditionalParagraph_manchukou120]"

     manchukou.121.d: "Emperor Puyi drove through the streets of Xinjing. He did not like this city; he had always preferred the old Manchu capital of Mukden. He began to peer into the formation of guards guarding his route. Something was different from the days when he had arrived here as a hostage of the Japanese military. It suddenly struck him - ordinary people! Yes, ordinary Chinese, or now Manchurians, or always Manchurians, but the main thing was their sincere desire to greet their emperor. That's the difference between today and the old days. Men take off their hats and raise them in the air, children try to peer through the rows of soldiers, women whisper and giggle. After all these years, has he finally earned this monarchical honour? The men have stopped scrounging for the bare necessities of life, and the Japanese have stopped treating them as expendable. So few words, and such a long road to this seemingly happy ending.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Emperor realises that he is still in a rather powerless position, but what is surprising is that the people he spoke of are freer and more free than he is. They now have real political representation and the ability to influence government decisions. A constitutional monarch has it more elusively. Moreover, the real 'happy ending' to the long story of the formation of Manchukuo was not thanks to Puyi, but to some extent in spite of him and his actions. This paradise was built by very different people."

Before his departure, he had familiarized himself with the Ishiwara-Miyazaki report and suggested that, by utilizing Manchuria's coal, iron, and other mineral resources, a significant volume of aircraft and armored vehicles could be produced. When Yōsuke Matsuoka, the Director-General of Mantetsu, learned of this, he decided to invite Ayukawa as a guest of the South Manchuria Railway and provided him with a private plane to facilitate his tour."

The defeat was total. Matsuoka told some Mantetsu employees that after the creation of the industrial division in 1936, the restructuring had, for all practical purposes, ended. He cautioned his corporation's employees against boycotting work for the military. He willingly took measures to satisfy the military's demands. However, the military did not even extend him the common courtesy of consulting with him beforehand.\n\nHe had no idea that his \"nephew,\" Kishi Nobusuke, the Deputy Minister of Commerce in the Manchukuo government, was one of the key players who fully supported Ayukawa's plan. When he learned of this, his response, understandably, was brief: \"Et tu, Nobusuke!\".\n\nHe had befriended young and mid-ranking officers, trying to be their mentor and friend.

As for Satō himself, he wished to follow Matsuoka's example.\n\n- Oh no, this is a special occasion, - Matsuoka insisted.\n- Let's drink all night then, - Satō joined in.\n\nBy midnight, Matsuoka could no longer continue.

Some employees complained that, partly due to his considerable talent, Matsuoka rarely consulted with them.\n\nHowever, engineers, scientists, and other technology specialists never made any of these negative remarks. Matsuoka enjoyed their company and believed that Mantetsu should become a leader in applied sciences. The Mantetsu Central Research Institute became an organization directly subordinate to his office. When Matsuoka took office, the position of the institute's director was vacant. He immediately asked the president of Tohoku University, Inoue Jinkichi, to help him find a first-class candidate for the position.

He believed that implementing the Mantetsu plan would take ten to twenty years. A simpler method would be to import the necessary capital goods from abroad. There was no need to start from zero. His replacement plan involved creating a new corporation with a capitalization of three billion yen. Of this, one billion yen was to come from the United States, which would be used to import means of production from the United States.\n\nAyukawa's plan paralleled Ishiwara's idea of importing technology for automobile production from the United States and aircraft from Germany. Ishiwara wanted Ayukawa to do the job, and to make his offer to Ayukawa more attractive and the five-year plan more effective, he began a serious study of separating the Showa Steel Works and the Wushun Coal Mines from Mantetsu to facilitate their transfer to Ayukawa's proposed new conglomerate.\n\nHowever, Ishiwara failed to quickly convince other officers, especially from the Kwantung Army, who became obstinate on the issue, wishing to keep Mantetsu as the guiding force of the upcoming five-year plan."

He managed to establish contact with the Japanese, who supported his rule financially and with advisors, and in return, he did not interfere with their economic dominance in Northeast China. However, this relationship was never stable: constant struggles within the Japanese bureaucracy, as well as on the battlefields of China, meant that Zhang was not sure of his patrons in Tokyo, and they were not sure of him.\n\nIt all ended in 1928 – the Nationalist Revolution of the Kuomintang reached the Great Wall, bringing with it an anti-imperialist fervor, and Zhang Zuolin himself was blown up in his train as he returned, defeated, from Beijing to Mukden. The explosion was organized by an obscure colonel of the Kwantung Army, and those who ordered it remain unknown, as the Japanese were never able to organize a trial and a full investigation.\n\nHis son, the \"Young Marshal\" Zhang Xueliang, came to power in Manchuria, and unexpectedly for everyone, he was able to subordinate the Fengtian clique and manage it effectively.

A similar thing later happened in Inner Mongolia, which was divided into a Western, Russian part, and an Eastern, Japanese part.\n\nIn 1906, on the basis of a railway branch leading from the port of Dalian to Mukden, the South Manchuria Railway Company, or Mantetsu, was founded. Baron Gotō Shinpei became its first president. Gotō wanted to create his company in the image of the British East India Company, unburdened by the bureaucratic complexities existing in Japan. He expressed the hope that his company would become a dominant force on the Asian continent, like the East India Company. The company once was just that.\n\nIt seemed a dazzling beacon of stability and prosperity in China. Very soon it turned into a giant conglomerate, combining railways, banks, mines, factories, hotels, and so on. In addition, it received the unique right to manage an extraterritorial zone along the railway itself, so that by the early 1920s it had become a kind of \"state within a state\" with almost all its functions, governing the huge Japanese population of Manchuria.\n\nManchuria became the \"Japanese frontier,\" just as Americans once settled their continent and Russians settled Siberia, Manchuria seemed the same to the Japanese. And Mantetsu became their support. The best graduates of Japanese universities went there to work, and besides, there was not such strong police oppression as in Japan itself, so many intellectuals, especially of left-wing views, moved there. The concept of a \"lifeline for Japan\" emerged – Mongolia and Manchuria, which would help the Land of the Rising Sun to become on par with such giants as Britain, Russia, and the USA."

     manchukou.143.t: "The History of Manchuria - The Beautiful Asia of the Future"
     manchukou.143.d: "Naturally, the breakdown of the old rules, the arrival of the Nationalist Revolution in Manchuria, and its use by the Young Marshal for his own purposes did not lead to the establishment of good relations between the Chinese and Japanese populations of the region. The local population began to self-organize and create their own political societies, appealing to the government in Tokyo to take care of them, but the Japanese government of the time adopted a position of strict non-interference in China's affairs.\n\nThis became the cause of a surprising alliance between these local Japanese civilian \"politicians\" and a group of mid-ranking officers from the Kwantung Army. In the summer of 1931, they established contact with each other and literally \"found each other.\" The Japanese military had been dreaming of forcibly severing Manchuria from China for more than 10 years; during the Great War, various conspiracies were organized with attempts to restore the Manchu dynasty here and establish a separate state like Mongolia and Tibet, but they all failed. They ceased with the establishment of Zhang Zuolin's rule, with whom the Japanese military and civilian politicians were able to establish relations.\n\nNow the Japanese military had no restraining factor in the form of Zhang Zuolin, but instead, an almost official reason for invasion appeared – the protection of the local population since the government in Tokyo did not care for them. Moreover, Japanese Manchurian intellectuals formulated a beautiful goal – the creation of a new state in Manchuria based on the equal status of races and peoples, the establishment of order in public life, the elimination of banditry, and all-round modernization. All this would ultimately show the whole world an amazing example of Pan-Asianism, the rallying of local peoples and the unification of their efforts, which could then be spread further so that Asia could finally compete on equal terms with European countries."
     manchukou.143.a: "A beautiful picture, but what was the result?"
     manchukou.143.b: "Thank you for the history lesson"

     manchukou.144.t: "The History of Manchuria - The Manchurian Incident"
     manchukou.144.d: "The military agreed to help. These were two specific military men – Colonel Seishirō Itagaki and Lieutenant Colonel Kanji Ishiwara. The second was actually the leader in this duo, although junior in rank. On September 18, 1931, they staged a railway explosion and moved loyal units into Manchuria. The government in Tokyo was stunned – it had already been living for six months under the threat of a coup, and now the Kwantung Army began to act on its own. However, the government of the time tried to stop its military but failed – this was one of the first manifestations of such insubordination, but far from the last.\n\nThe result was the withdrawal of Chinese authority from Manchuria in the person of the Young Marshal with his army and the proclamation here of the state of Manchukuo – that very ideal project of the future for all peoples. The deposed emperor Puyi, who had long been looking for a way to regain his throne, was chosen as the head of state. However, the beautiful plan very quickly collided with harsh reality. The Kwantung Army began to establish its own order at every step, turning the independent government of Manchukuo into a decoration for its personal power.\n\nEven the initiators of the seizure of Manchuria, Itagaki and Ishiwara, were not complete victors in this situation – it certainly brought them wild popularity at home, but at the same time hatred from their senior comrades and envy from other mid-ranking officers. They managed to form their own \"Manchurian Faction\" in the army, but they were literally pushed aside from the administration of the new state. Power was taken by those military men to whom slogans about racial equality were absolutely alien, although of course, as is often the case with the Japanese, Ishiwara's supporters were not completely subordinated and continued the bureaucratic battle for their vision of Manchukuo."
     manchukou.144.a: "And what happened to Mantetsu?"

     manchukou.145.t: "The History of Manchuria - The Fate of Mantetsu"
     manchukou.145.d: "Before the Manchurian Incident, the South Manchuria Railway and the Kwantung Army were equal partners in implementing Japan's continental policy, with Mantetsu taking responsibility for economic matters and the army for military ones. Now, regarding economic matters, the officers believed in the need to \"keep the Japanese zaibatsu out of Manchukuo\" and to create a controlled economy based on the principle of \"one industry, one company.\" The largest conglomerate, Mantetsu, was the main obstacle to the implementation of this principle. The Kwantung Army officers' solution to this problem was to keep Mantetsu as a railway company but to separate it from its other activities.\n\nHowever, the military could not act quickly – the South Manchuria Railway had been too significant a player for decades, and so since the autumn of 1933, when the first plan for the \"restructuring of Mantetsu\" was proposed, there had been no real action in this direction.\n\nIn August 1935, Yōsuke Matsuoka – a famous Japanese diplomat and possibly the most famous Japanese person in the world – became the new president of Mantetsu. This position was established after he led the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations during the investigation of the Manchurian Incident and especially after his famous walkout from the League, when he led the entire delegation out after the unfavorable conclusion of its commission of inquiry. Returning home, he became a national hero, and taking advantage of his popularity, he launched his personal political campaign under the slogan of \"dissolving political parties\" and various reforms. However, his attempt to become prime minister failed due to hatred from the top elites, and he was offered the position of president of Mantetsu, under whose founder he had once worked in the diplomatic service, as well as in the corporation itself in the 1920s."
     manchukou.145.a: "And what did Mr. Matsuoka do?"
     manchukou.145.b: "Let's end it here"

     manchukou.146.t: "The History of Manchuria - Matsuoka's Difficult Struggle"
     manchukou.146.d: "Matsuoka played a complex game. On the one hand, he tried to enlist the support of mid-ranking officers to achieve his political ambitions. Thus, it was partly at their suggestion that he was offered the post of president of Mantetsu. On the other hand, they wanted him to dismantle Mantetsu – the very thing he least desired. He was given conditions to carry out the company's restructuring in exchange for the position, to which he agreed. The main thing he understood was that he had not specified how the restructuring would look. Matsuoka was a resourceful man. He knew that the Kwantung Army actively used the services of Japanese businessmen, scientists, and experts as advisors. A man of his standing should be appointed supreme advisor, and he asked the army commander to grant him this title. In this capacity, he thought he could influence the Kwantung Army's policy from within, in the interests of Mantetsu.\n\nHere Matsuoka again overestimated his importance. The staff officers readily agreed to appoint him supreme advisor, superior in rank to all other advisors, but, like the others, he was not allowed to participate in policy-making. As if to emphasize the insignificance of his role, he was allocated a small room, more like a cubicle, as an office in the center of the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Xinjing. Matsuoka, in turn, refused to use this office. The seeds of discord were visible from the very beginning."
     manchukou.146.a: "You can work in that cubicle yourselves"

     manchukou.147.t: "The History of Manchuria - The Main Competitor"
     manchukou.147.d: "In addition to the threat of restructuring, Mantetsu's position was also weakened by the creation of the Manchukuo government, which was able to attract high-ranking officials from Japan and otherwise successfully compete with the company for personnel. New opportunities, higher salaries, and benefits all combined to make working for the Manchukuo government attractive. In 1936, Kishi Nobusuke, the most promising official in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, took a position in the Manchukuo government. He also left his post in Tokyo to become Deputy Minister of Industry. Most of them were in their late thirties - energetic, ambitious, and highly capable people.\n\nHaving come to Manchuria of their own free will, they shared strikingly similar views with the Kwantung Army officers and had easy access to them. The army itself left nothing to chance in its control over the Manchukuo government. This setup negatively affected the morale of Mantetsu employees. Now its employees suddenly had to apply for administrative decisions to the Manchukuo government, knowing full well that the Kwantung Army officers were the real masters behind the scenes. Upon becoming president, Matsuoka immediately set about restoring discipline in the company."
     manchukou.147.a: "Tough times..."
     manchukou.147.b: "I think I've had enough"

     manchukou.148.t: "The History of Manchuria - Matsuoka's Cautious Strategy"
     manchukou.148.d: "Matsuoka was forced to agree to the restructuring of Mantetsu as a condition of his appointment. However, philosophically, he was not against restructuring as such. The corporation had grown too quickly to unmanageable proportions. Its capitalization was 800 million yen, but its total assets exceeded two billion yen. It was engaged in more than forty types of commercial activities and had eighty subsidiaries. Its workforce exceeded 53,000 people, making it the largest company organized in Japan to date.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Manchurian Incident until Matsuoka became president of Mantetsu, the company's growth was phenomenal: the number of employees increased by more than 100 percent. Thus, rational management required rationalization. This could be achieved through a careful restructuring of the company, and the Kwantung Army's call for its restructuring was not necessarily to be taken negatively.\n\nWhen Matsuoka took office as president, the Kwantung Army suspended public discussion of Mantetsu's restructuring. They already had Matsuoka's promise to undertake this task, and Matsuoka demonstrated his goodwill by appointing Tanaka Seijirō, a former director of Mantetsu, as his consultant for developing the restructuring plan. Matsuoka also sent Miyazaki Masayoshi from the Tokyo branch of Mantetsu on leave to work for Ishiwara, who in August 1935 was appointed director of military operations in the General Staff.\n\nFor Matsuoka, it was politically and personally attractive to work with Ishiwara. This officer had accompanied him during the League of Nations sessions, and in those days when they lived in Geneva, Matsuoka often told Ishiwara: \"If I become prime minister, you will be my war minister.\""
     manchukou.148.a: "Whether Matsuoka can save Mantetsu or not, we shall see"

     manchukou.149.t: "The History of Manchuria - Puyi's Gilded Cage"
     manchukou.149.d: "Although Puyi was submissive to the Japanese in public, in his private life he was constantly in conflict with them. He resented being the \"head of state\" and then the \"emperor of Manchukuo,\" rather than being fully restored as the Qing emperor. During his enthronement ceremony, he clashed with the Japanese over his attire: they wanted him to wear a military uniform similar to that used by the Manchukuo army, while he considered it an insult to wear anything other than traditional Manchu robes. In a typical compromise, he wore a Western military uniform for his enthronement, becoming the only Chinese emperor ever to do so, and a dragon robe for the announcement of his accession at the Temple of Heaven.\n\nThe Japanese chose the industrial city of Changchun as the capital of Manchukuo, which was renamed Xinjing. Puyi wanted the capital to be Mukden, which had been the Qing capital before the conquest of China in 1644, but this option was rejected by his Japanese masters. Puyi hated Xinjing, which he considered an unremarkable industrial city with no historical connection to the Qing, unlike Mukden. Since there was no palace in Changchun, the emperor moved into what was once the office of the Salt Tax Administration during the Russian period, and as a result, the building became known as the Salt Tax Palace. Puyi lived there virtually as a prisoner and could not leave without permission.\n\nThe difference in power can be seen in the fact that the Kwantung Army had a \"huge\" headquarters in the center of Xinjing, while Puyi had to live in a \"small and shabby\" palace near the main railway station in a part of Xinjing with numerous small factories, warehouses, and slaughterhouses, the main prison, and the red-light district."
     manchukou.149.a: "How did he even end up in this situation"

     manchukou.150.t: "The History of Manchuria - Puyi's Intentions"
     manchukou.150.d: "For his entire conscious life after his expulsion from the Forbidden City, Puyi sought ways to restore his throne. Various representatives of the Manchu clan, militarists, and even Russian emigrants came to him offering various ambitious restoration plans, and Puyi tried to give money to all of them. In essence, this turned into a way of begging for money from him. When the Japanese offered him to head the newly formed state, he quickly agreed – it would have been strange to expect otherwise from him. He secretly fled from Tianjin where he was living, not even taking his wife with him, who, however, did not want to go anywhere, understanding what awaited them.\n\nPuyi knew from his negotiations in Tianjin with Colonels Kenji Doihara and Seishirō Itagaki that he was dealing with \"ruthless people and that this might be the kind of regime to be expected.\" He later recalled: \"I stuck my head into the tiger's mouth by going to Manchuria in 1931.\" Puyi had virtually no education; it was limited to lessons given to him by his British tutor, one of his closest confidants. Therefore, he understood that his chances of outplaying the Japanese were very slim and only subconsciously felt that he could play on the contradictions within the Kwantung Army, as well as rely on his supporters, of whom there were enough, but whom the Japanese military tried to get rid of."
     manchukou.150.a: "If the smartest Japanese diplomat has little chance against the military, then Puyi's are minimal"

     manchukou.151.t: "The Veneration of Puyi"
     manchukou.151.d: "Puyi often visited the provinces of Manchukuo to open factories and mines, took part in Hirohito's birthday celebrations at the Kwantung Army headquarters, and on the Japanese Memorial Day officially paid homage in Japanese rituals to the souls of Japanese soldiers who died fighting \"bandits\" — the Japanese term for all partisans who fought against their rule in Manchuria. Following Japan's example, schoolchildren in Manchukuo at the beginning of each school day would first bow towards Tokyo, and then to a portrait of Puyi in the classroom. He found this \"intoxicating.\" He visited a coal mine and in his elementary Japanese thanked the Japanese foreman for his good work, who burst into tears, thanking the emperor."
     manchukou.151.a: "Such treatment could affect his condition"

     manchukou.152.t: "A Living Death"
     manchukou.152.d: "Gradually, Puyi's old supporters were eliminated and replaced by pro-Japanese \"minders.\" During this period, Puyi's life mostly consisted of signing laws prepared by Japan, reading prayers, consulting oracles, and making official visits throughout his state. The emperor was extremely dissatisfied with his life as a virtual prisoner in the Salt Tax Palace, and his mood became unstable, fluctuating from hours of passively staring into space to indulging his sadism by beating his servants.\n\nHis orphaned pageboys, most of whose parents had been killed by the Japanese, lived in the palace in such \"terrible\" conditions that at the age of eighteen they were the size of ten-year-old children. Puyi was obsessed with the fact that the vast majority of his \"loving subjects\" hated him, and it was the knowledge that he was an object of hatred and ridicule that drove the emperor to the brink of madness. Puyi always had a streak of strong cruelty, and he imposed harsh \"house rules\" on his staff: servants were flogged in the basement for offenses such as \"irresponsible talk.\" The phrase \"Take him downstairs\" was greatly feared by Puyi's servants, as he ordered at least one flogging per day, and everyone in the Palace was beaten with canes at one time or another, except for the empress, Puyi's siblings, and their spouses.\n\nPuyi's experience with large-scale theft during his time in the Forbidden City made him distrust his servants, and he obsessively checked the account books for signs of fraud. To further torment his staff of about 100 people, Puyi drastically cut the food allocated to his employees, who suffered from hunger. Besides tormenting his staff, Puyi's life as emperor was filled with a lethargy and passivity that could be called a \"living death.\""
     manchukou.152.a: "Puyi is trying to make everyone as miserable as he is"

     manchukou.152.t: "Endless Humiliation"
     manchukou.152.d: "Puyi became a devout Buddhist, mystic, and vegetarian - Buddha statues were placed throughout the Salt Tax Palace for him to pray to. He also forbade his staff from eating meat. His Buddhism led him to forbid his staff from killing insects or mice, but if he found insects in his food, the cooks were flogged. Once, while walking in the garden, Puyi discovered that a servant had written in chalk on one of the stones: \"Haven't the Japanese humiliated you enough?\"\n\nWhen Puyi received guests at the Salt Tax Palace, he would give them long lectures on the \"glorious\" history of the Qing as a form of masochism, comparing the great Qing emperors to himself, a pathetic man living as a prisoner in his own palace. Wanrong, who hated her husband, loved to mock him behind his back, putting on skits for the servants, wearing dark glasses and imitating Puyi's sharp movements. During his time in Tianjin, Puyi began wearing dark glasses all the time. In the interwar period, dark glasses were worn by members of Tianjin's homosexual \"tiny minority\" to signify their orientation. Although Puyi was likely aware of this, surviving members of his court said that he \"was indeed prone to eye strain and headaches from bright sunlight.\""
     manchukou.152.a: "Unhappy people, unhappy country" # How is Wanrong herself, by the way?
