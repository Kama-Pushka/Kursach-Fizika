 agrarian_nationalism: "Agrarian Nationalism"
 agrarian_nationalism_desc: "Agrarian Nationalism is a political movement that originated during the Meiji Revolution, but in its modern form was born after the Great War. It assumes that the basis of the nation and the state is connected with the peasantry, since it is it that preserves the true spirit of Japan. Agrarian nationalism opposes modern aspirations for the centralization of public administration and wants to establish maximum self-government within the framework of village communities, which the emperor himself will unite."

Идеологией Народной Антиимпериалистической ассоциации были «Шесть великих политик», изданных Шэном в декабре 1934 года. Эта идеология гарантировала его ранее принятый «Великий манифест из восьми пунктов». Они включали «антиимпериализм, дружбу с Советским Союзом, расовое и национальное равенство, чистое правительство, мир и восстановление». Шэн называл их «умелым, жизненным применением марксизма, ленинизма и сталинизма в условиях феодального общества экономически и культурно отсталого Синьцзяна». Они служили идеологической основой правления Шэна. С провозглашением Шести великих политик Шэн принял новый флаг с шестиконечной звездой, обозначающий эту политику. Отделения «партии Шэна» были созданы в том числе и на Алтае, где их возглавил ханец Пэй Чжинцзе.§!"

Это связано с большим числом сбежавших из СССР кочевников в ходе коллективизации там, и которые боятся возобновление такой политики теперь и в Синьцзяне.
