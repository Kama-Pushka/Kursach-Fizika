 ### EVENTS
 tibet.1.t:0 "Organizing the search for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation"
 tibet.1.d:0 "Two and a half years ago the last Dalai Lama passed away. After his death, each of the Lamas is reborn in Tibetan lands. As the chief face of our faith, his quest is the first priority for the regent and his government. With this in mind, the regent convened a national gathering to begin the search for the Dalai Lama's new reincarnation. The regent told the assembly about his visions last year at Lake lhamblamtsho. He saw in his reflection the letters "a," "ka," and "ma," a monastery with a turquoise roof, a pagoda with a gilded roof a path leading east to a bare hill opposite a house with a blue roof. The vision was deciphered that Lama's soul turned east after his death, and was reborn in Amdo, a province formerly belonging to Tibet. But the regent's words did not convince everyone of the truthfulness of his visions. Part of the assembly, led by Lönchen Langdong, insisted that Lama had been reborn here in Lhasa. He claimed that the reincarnation was the son of one of his relatives because one of the previous Dalai Lama's horses broke out of the stables and ran toward the boy's house as if after a long separation from his master."

The assembly voted almost unanimously to remove the regent and appointed a new man to take his place: Landun, who was less authoritative and more controlling."

After appropriately testing the candidate with various relics and toys of the previous Dalai Lama, he said: "That's mine, that's mine!"

 tibet.40.t:0 "A new regent must be chosen"
 tibet.40.d:0 "After the current regent has decided to resign his post, what remains to be decided is to whom to pass it on? Jampel was leaning toward the candidacy of Daz Avang Songrao, an elderly monk who would not manage to gain enough influence in a few years to hold the post upon Jampel's return. But there is another option. There have long been rumors in the West of a certain Dalai Lama of the West who would not have enough support in our country. Who better to raise a new Dalai Lama than another Dalai Lama?"
 tibet.40.a:0 "The best educator of the Dalai Lama would be an old monk"

Our country is prospering, people are happier, and now it's not just monks and llamas, it's everyone who matters! But when we look around we forget about the other Buddhists, that they are not as happy as we are in other countries. We must rectify this, and help them free themselves, as our people once did! We may not have found Shambhala, but we can create it, right here in this country!"

 tibet.43.a:0 "This will help us"
 
 tibet.44.t:0 "Scandal among the Lhasa aristocracy"

 tibet.48.d:0 "Losar is the Tibetan holiday of the New Year. It is one of the favorite folk festivals of Buddhism, during which many interesting things happen: ritual dances of beasts and skeletons, the black hat dance, the sword dance, stage battles between good and evil, torchlight performances and the Tsam New Year mystery, in which various historical and mythological characters take part."
 tibet.48.a:0 "It's a beautiful holiday"

Despite his leftist views, he took a favorable view of some of the Lamas' interventions and seemed to have a generally positive view of Buddhism.\n\n\nAfter the speech, the national assembly and the Kashag gave him the authority to carry out these reforms. Perhaps the reasoning behind this was to move the regent, the annexation of Xikang lands, or maybe his armed men at the door? \n\nWho knows..."

Perhaps our own."
 tibet.60.desc_chinese_warlord:0 "Sad news has come to us - the Buddhist leader Panchen Lama IX has died from a long-suffering illness. Recently, he practically refused treatment, as he lost hope for the realization of life goals. It is possible that if the political events in the country had developed a little differently, he would have lived for a few more years, but now everything has irrevocably changed. The enthusiasm and popularity that he possessed is unlikely to be able to make up for his reincarnation - especially since he will still be too young and he will rather turn out to be a puppet in someone's hands."

 tibet.61.desc:0 "Having overthrown the current government, the Panchen Lama proclaimed himself regent of the young Dalai Lama and promised to teach him everything a lama should be able to do. Meanwhile, the borders of Tibet became open to the Chinese, and Chinese troops who had entered the country began to occupy the border. It became obvious to everyone that Tibet's independence could be forgotten, but perhaps it was for the best."
