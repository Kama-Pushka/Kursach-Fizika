 #Ideas
     YSC_the_secret_society_uprising_idea: "The Rise of the Secret Society"
     YSC_the_secret_society_uprising_idea_desc: "Like other secret societies in China, the exact origins and activities of the Yellow Sand Society are difficult to determine. Chinese secret societies changed names from time to time and were highly decentralized, with several branches with different names operating as part of the same movement. Sometimes completely unrelated groups also bore the same name. Thus, it is difficult to make a clear distinction between secret societies. After the collapse of the Qing Empire, the Yellow Path Society opposed the new Republican government. This was unusual because most secret societies preferred to cooperate with the new regime until the mid-1920s. Their main ideas were the restoration of the Ming Dynasty and millenarianism, that is, the belief in the coming of good times after some radical transformation of society"

     YSC_enchanted_soldiers_dyn_desc: "The leader of the uprising, an unknown Taoist monk, had great oratorical and organizational skills, thanks to which he was able not only to gather an army of his loyal supporters, but also to convince them of invulnerability from enemy bullets, which is why his army made such a desperate attempt to rebel against the Japanese authorities"

But in order to lead such large organizations of soldiers, it is impossible not to create some kind of leadership position, but the monk did it wisely, creating the so-called “Monk's Council”, which included ordinary peasants who wished to do so. The monk made the final decisions by consulting and discussing certain issues, thus becoming «the first among equals»"

     yellowsand.1.t: "Monk's Death"
     yellowsand.1.desc: "In the last battle against the invaders, the leader of our rebellion, as he had always done before, rushed into the enemy positions in the first line to inspire other soldiers by his personal example, but it seems that he himself was not so immortal - as a result of being hit by a bullet, the monk fell in the middle of the battlefield. In his place, Chang Yintang, the leader of one of the other factions of the Yellow Sand Society who had joined us after the uprising began, took over the command"
     yellowsand.1.a: "We will avenge this and other deaths!"
     yellowsand.2.t: "The Death of Tse Tsan-tai"
     yellowsand.2.desc: "One of China's first anti-Qing Chinese revolutionaries, Tse Tsan-tai, died today in our capital at his government office"
     yellowsand.2.a: "It's sad"
     yellowsand.3.t: "Secret Society has Seized Power in East Hebei"
     yellowsand.3.desc: "From Eastern Hebei, which is currently under the de facto rule of Japan and the protection of the Kwantung Army, came surprising news - the local government proclaimed in the city of Tongzhou was overthrown by supporters of the secret society Yellow Sands, which aims to restore the Ming dynasty on the territory of China. It is still unclear how they managed to do it, but some analysts suggest that the hand of Japanese spies was involved, who decided to create another monarchical puppet state similar to Manchukuo-Go, and to confirm its legitimacy played «theater with rebellion»"
     yellowsand.3.a: "The Ming Dynasty? Did they have any pretenders left to the throne?"
     yellowsand.4.t: "Difficult Search"
     yellowsand.4.desc: "The two main goals of our rebellion are to fight the Japanese invaders and to restore the rule of the Ming dynasty. Since we have a temporary respite from fighting the Japanese, we should use it wisely by bringing a Ming monarch to power, albeit in a small piece of territory under our control. This action will confirm the legitimacy of our actions and our government after some of the reputational losses we suffered during the uprising itself and the death of its initiator, an obscure Taoist monk who promised soldiers invulnerability and other magical things.\n\nWhen the Manchus invaded China, at first they tried to destroy all possible pretenders of the previous dynasty, but after some time the mindless terror stopped and now we know for sure about the existence of two successors of the Ming emperors. The first and most famous is the Duke of Extended Grace, or Duke Zhu, or Zhu Yousong. His honorary title was retained until 1935, when the republican government finally abolished it because Zhu Yousong, being an extremely poor man, stole from the guard of the tomb of the Ming emperors and then fled to Manchukuo to his close friend Emperor Puyi. However, he was not needed by the Japanese and there he continued his miserable and poor existence, so he will certainly not refuse our offer to become a monarch.\n\nAn alternative candidate, with a cleaner reputation, is the minor Zhu Rongji from a family of wealthy landowners in Hunan province. Their family legend says they are descended from the first ruler of the Ming Dynasty. Since Zhu is too young, it would be convenient and necessary to organize a regency under him"
     yellowsand.4.a: "Our choice is Zhu Yousong" 
     yellowsand.4.b: "Our choice is Zhu Rongji"
     yellowsand.5.t: "Zhu Yousong's Arrival"
     yellowsand.5.desc: "From the northeast, Zhu Yousong, the last Duke of Extended Grace, arrived in the temporary capital of our government with his small family of his wife and two sons. The appearance of the pretender to the throne caused a burst of enthusiasm among his supporters. Yousong himself was greatly surprised that the secret society wishing for the restoration of his dynasty not only survived to this day, but also managed to self-organize and rebel against the local authorities, establishing its own government. The only thing that overshadows this event is the Duke's tarnished reputation due to his corruption scandals in the Kuomintang's finance ministry and his escape to the northeast with Emperor Puyi"
     yellowsand.5.a: "People give strength to the emperor, and the emperor gives strength to the people"
     yellowsand.6.t: "Zhu Rongji's Arrival"
     yellowsand.6.desc: "Zhu Rongji, a minor candidate for the throne of the Ming dynasty, and his relatives, provincial landowners, arrived from Hunan Province to the provisional capital of our government. The appearance of the pretender to the throne caused a burst of enthusiasm among his supporters. Rongji himself and his relatives were greatly surprised that the secret society wishing for the restoration of the Ming dynasty not only survived to this day, but also managed to self-organize and rebel against the local authorities, establishing its own government"
     yellowsand.6.a: "People give strength to the emperor, and the emperor gives strength to the people"
     yellowsand.7.t: "The Restoration of Emperor Zhu Yousong."
     yellowsand.7.desc: "Today in our temporary capital, which houses the government and also houses the emperor's makeshift «palace,» a major event that many people have been waiting several years for took place: the restoration of Ming Dynasty monarch Zhu Yousong. This move should help increase our supporters across the country. However, now the regent of the state faces the question of transferring power to the legitimate ruler, as Zhu has all the rights to them, but at the same time - tarnished reputation with a corruption scandal and stay on the territory of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo"
     yellowsand.7.a: "Long live the Emperor!"
     yellowsand.8.t: "The Restoration of Emperor Zhu Rongji"
     yellowsand.8.desc: "Today in our temporary capital, which houses the government and also houses the emperor's makeshift «palace,» a major event that many people have been waiting several years for took place: the restoration of Ming Dynasty monarch Zhu Rongji. This move should help increase our supporters across the country. Since the emperor himself is not yet of age, the regent Chang Yintang will continue to rule for him"
     yellowsand.8.a: "Long live the Emperor!"
     yellowsand.9.t: "Transfer of Full Power to the Emperor"
     yellowsand.9.desc: "Today, the interim regent of the state officially handed over full power to the new Ming Dynasty emperor, Zhu Yousong. The regent will remain in the government but will not play a leadership role. Now Zhu Yousong has a unique chance to restore and confirm the positive image of his ancestral empire, but he has many enemies - primarily thanks to the Manchurian Qing Empire, which not only destroyed his dynasty, but also undermined the popularity of the monarchy in the eyes of ordinary people. However, Yousong has developed a circle of people during his time in Manchukuo who can help him put his plans into action"
     yellowsand.9.a: "Let's hope they can speak Chinese and not just Japanese"
     yellowsand.10.t: "Consolidation of the Regent's Power"
     yellowsand.10.desc: "Due to the fact that the chosen Emperor Zhu Rongji is still under the age of majority, Chang Yintang will remain as his regent. If this fact is used correctly, it can be a blow to the reputation of our government, as well as in its favor, depending on the regent's actions. In addition, he will have to think about what he will have to do when the emperor comes of age, even though it will not be that soon"
     yellowsand.10.a: "It seems only in the distant year 1946 that this would begin to alarm us"
     yellowsand.11.t: "Emperor's Coming of Age" 
     yellowsand.11.desc: "Emperor Zhu Rongji has reached the age of majority and can now become the rightful ruler of his empire. This is an important event for our nation, as many people have been waiting for this moment for a long time. Over the years, young Zhu Rongji has been diligently prepared for his position, so if he gains power, it is likely that there will be some changes in rule"
     yellowsand.11.a: "If he does get the power"
     yellowsand.11.b: "It's time to turn the board over"
     yellowsand.11.c: "It's time to turn the board over"
     yellowsand.12.t: "Unexpected Death of a Regent"
     yellowsand.12.desc: "Regent of the [ROOT.GetLeader] died unexpectedly a few hours before the ceremony to hand over power to the adult emperor Zhu Rongji. Some advisers told the monarch that the regent had evil intentions about the ceremony - allegedly, he was not going to transfer power to the emperor, but to imprison him in the palace, and himself to declare himself perpetual ruler of the country. Apparently, Zhu did not believe much in what he was told and rather agreed with the version about the death of the regent from old age"
     yellowsand.12.a: "He was hardly capable of such a thing"
     yellowsand.13.t: "Regent Commits Coup d'etat"
     yellowsand.13.desc: "Regent of the [ROOT.GetLeader] once he had tasted power, he decided not to part with it for the rest of his life. Instead of the expected ceremony of handing over power to the emperor, the regent imprisoned the latter in the palace and declared his reign to be perpetual. He managed to pull off such a plot with the help of people loyal to him since the first uprising against the Japanese government. However, it is still unknown how it will be accepted by ordinary people who have long awaited Zhu Rongji's adulthood as a harbinger of good times"
     yellowsand.13.a: "Let's watch the reaction"
     yellowsand.14.t: "Regent's Removal"
     yellowsand.14.desc: "The rule of the regent Chang Yintang under the powerless emperor Zhu Yousong has not led to the expected results - the population of the controlled territories revolts because of the lost hope for the return of the beautiful times under the Ming Empire. In addition, the regent failed to fully consolidate around him the elites of the state, because of which a conspiracy around the figure of the emperor has matured behind his back. In order to restore public trust and not destroy our state, the regent was required to resign, returning full power to the emperor's hands"
     yellowsand.14.a: "Regent has no one to turn to for help, so he'll have to give in."
     yellowsand.15.t: "Regent's Removal"
     yellowsand.15.desc: "Regent Chang Yintang's attempt to retain full power under the powerless Emperor Zhu Rongji has led to the expected results - the population of the territories under his control is revolting because of the lost hope for the return of the beautiful times under the Ming Empire. This fact in turn has already undermined the trust of the people around him - if previously loyal to him they were ready to support his ambitious political adventures, now they are ready to sacrifice it, for the sake of preserving their position. In order to restore public confidence and not to destroy our state, the regent was required to resign, returning full power to the hands of the emperor"
     yellowsand.15.a: "Now the Regent certainly has no one to turn to for help."
     yellowsand.16.t: "Secret Address"
     yellowsand.16.desc: "Our representatives in Manchuria have been contacted by a certain person who represents the monarchical Ming Government in China. Emperor Zhu Yousong, the former Duke of Extended Grace, who lived in Manchukuo with Emperor Puyi, with whom he was very closely associated, is now ruling there. There he managed to accumulate enough connections that he now wants to use them to consolidate his rule over China. In essence he is offering to organize secret support for his government in exchange for future alliance relations between China and Japan"
     yellowsand.16.a: "It's too adventurous"
     yellowsand.16.b: "We agree with the proposal"
     yellowsand.17.t: "Refusal of the Japanese Representatives"
     yellowsand.17.desc: "We have not been able to negotiate with the Japanese for the secret support of our government in exchange for any conditions. On the other hand, this will prevent our adversaries from using this fact against us"
     yellowsand.17.a: "Let's try another plan"
     yellowsand.18.t: "Concurrence of the Japanese Representatives"
     yellowsand.18.desc: "We managed to negotiate with the Japanese to secretly support our government in exchange for giving Japanese companies in China special economic conditions and entry into their sphere of influence. The key now is to make sure that this information doesn't spread too soon"
     yellowsand.18.a: "Only the original leaders of the Secret Society rebellion may be disgruntled"
     yellowsand.19.t: "Disclosure of the Alliance with the Japanese"
     yellowsand.19.desc: "After all, we were not able to hide the information about our deal with the Japanese - rumors about it began to spread with great speed among the elites and soldiers of our army. If people's discontent is not too high, we will most likely be able to hold on to power. The newspapers are already calling this news “the second Nishihara loans” - the militarists of the Anhui clique lost power in 1920 precisely because of the revelation of their secret financing by the Japanese government"
     yellowsand.19.a: "It's a blow to millenarianism."
     yellowsand.20.t: "Change of Course"
     yellowsand.20.desc: "Today, our government officially announced its entry into the East Asian Sphere of Co-Prosperity led by the Empire of Japan. Thus, arising out of the anti-Japanese Secret Society rebellion, our government has completely changed sides in the Asian conflict. Naturally, this will cause resentment from many of the old members of the government, but overall it will help the Ming Dynasty finally regain control of China"
     yellowsand.20.a: "The main thing is that the price for this is not too high"
     yellowsand.21.t: "Reconciling Dynasties"
     yellowsand.21.desc: "Every time a new dynasty overthrew an old dynasty, it did not touch the representatives of that monarchical house, thus showing “reconciliation” between the monarchs and emphasizing its legitimacy. In addition, the old dynasty was given a special title - duchy. Thanks to this, a descendant of Confucius himself and the Shang dynasty has come down to us. Accordingly, the house of Aixin Gyoro now receives this title, which will be passed down from generation to generation"
     yellowsand.21.a: "At the same time, the Manchus themselves are almost exterminators of the representatives of the house of Min..."
     yellowsand.22.t: "Proposal for Mutual Recognition"
     yellowsand.22.desc: "After leaving the Yellow Sands secret society, the Ming loyalists managed to not only seize power in their province, but also find a pretender to the throne. He turned out to be none other than Duke of Extended Grace Zhu Yousong, who had recently resided in Manchuria. After the restoration, all the reins of power were placed in his hands. He himself, being very attached to the last Manchu Emperor Puyi, seems to have decided to negotiate an «alliance» with him in the form of mutual recognition of the two governments"
     yellowsand.22.a: "We agree"
     yellowsand.22.b: "Unfortunately, China can only have one monarchy"
     yellowsand.23.t: "Manchurian Government's Consent"
     yellowsand.23.desc: "Manchuria recognizes our independence, and we recognize their independent status. Thus, we have reached a consensus on borders and no longer claim each other's territories. This will allow us to quietly regain control of Chinese lands by destroying the republican governments without worrying about our home front"
     yellowsand.23.a: "Our Emperor's useful diplomacy"
     yellowsand.24.t: "Manchurian Government's Refusal"
     yellowsand.24.desc: "The Manchurians have refused to conduct official relations with our Government, in spite of attempts to obtain an audience through persons known to them. Thus they hint to us that without a military engagement with their army our relations «will not be improved»"
     yellowsand.24.a: "We have no choice but to focus our attention on the northeast."
     yellowsand.25.t: "The Min Government has Recognized Our Independence"
     yellowsand.25.desc: "Coming out of the Yellow Sands secret society, the Ming loyalists managed not only to seize power in their province, but also to find a pretender to the throne. They have now officially renounced the «territories of the national outskirts» that were enslaved by the Qing Empire. Thus, they are trying to secure our support"
     yellowsand.25.a: "Ming's government? And how many supporters do they have?" 
     yellowsand.26.t: "Public Discontent"
     yellowsand.26.desc: "The information that we have agreed with the peripheral separatist movements on mutual recognition has spread among the common people, leading to their natural discontent. Even many old members of the government disapprove of the move, and prominent intellectuals have spread the message in their newspapers that this has undermined any confidence in our government by proving the failure of the monarchist idea"
     yellowsand.26.a: "We're doing the right thing"
     yellowsand.27.t: "Taking the Side of the Monarchists"
     yellowsand.27.desc: "The monarchical government of the Ming dynasty, who have recently managed to seize power in a small piece of territory in the northeast of the country, offer us to come under their control in order to join their efforts. To this end, Wang Ying himself is offered a rather large personal reward"
     yellowsand.27.a: "We'll move on to them"
     yellowsand.27.b: "We'll move on to them"
     yellowsand.27.c: "We'll maintain the status quo"
     yellowsand.28.t: "Joining Wang Ying's Army"
     yellowsand.28.desc: "Our negotiations with Wang Ying were successful: he agreed to switch to our side for a bribe. However, this will undermine the influence of the old fighters and commanders of the Yellow Sand Society"
     yellowsand.28.a: "That's great."
     yellowsand.29.t: "Wang Ying's Rejection"
     yellowsand.29.desc: "Our negotiations with Wang Ying ended in failure - he did not agree to join our government, even though a large bribe was offered to him personally"
     yellowsand.29.a: "He's not such an important ally, though."
     yellowsand.30.t: "Choosing the Direction of Study"
     yellowsand.30.desc: "We need to choose a mentor for the young emperor, who will teach him all the necessary skills to rule the state. The future political views of the monarch will depend on which person to choose for this role"
     yellowsand.30.a: "Let's bring in a liberal pundit as a mentor"
     yellowsand.30.b: "Let's invite a conservative monarchist to take this role"
     yellowsand.30.c: "Let's pick a man from the Yellow Sand Society."
     yellowsand.31.t: "Monarchist Uprising"
     yellowsand.31.desc: "In Hunan province, a rebellion of monarchists began, declaring their loyalty to the Ming Empire and their government from Hebei. The center of the rebellion is believed to be the county from which the man Zhu Rongji comes from, whom they have recognized as their Emperor despite the fact that he is still very young. His family are major landowners in Hunan, which is believed to trace its history back to the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty"
     yellowsand.31.a: "And it all started as a Secret Society rebellion....."
     yellowsand.32.t: "Regent Retires"
     yellowsand.32.desc: "The current regent of the state, Chang Yintang, by inviting the minor emperor Zhu Rongji to the throne, on the one hand ensured a period of quiet rule until the monarch came of age, but on the other hand began to gradually introduce people from the Hunan clan of Zhu Rongji - his relatives, who were large landowners in their province - into the elite of the government. He needed this to create competition and gradually squeeze out of the government the old loyalists of the Yellow Sand Society, who resisted the reforms and the transition to a normal monarchical constitutional system, but at the same time he gave too much power to another faction, which itself wanted to take the place of the regent. The leader of these people turned out to be the emperor's uncle Zhu Kuanjun, who would become the new guardian of the throne until his nephew came of age"
     yellowsand.32.a: "However, Chang Yingtang will be allowed to stay in the government"
     yellowsand.33.t: "[YSCGetEventCountryLeaderT]"

     YSC_TITLE_LOC: "Choice of Constitution Project"
     yellowsand.33.desc: "[YSCGetEventCountryLeaderD]"
     YSC_WANG_YING_LOC_D: "The time has come to deal with the issue of drafting a constitution for our monarchy. The young monarch will soon be of age, so it is necessary to have a constitution in place before then so that Wang can keep all the levers of power in his hands as the rightful prime minister. In addition, adopting such a document will raise the popularity of our government in the eyes of the public and finally get rid of the notoriety of the Secret Society"
     YSC_DESC_LOC: "It is time to address the issue of drafting a constitution for our monarchy. [ROOT.GetLeader] has long felt that the burden of ruling such a huge state is not a task for him, so a constitution is a great way to get rid of direct rule. Besides, the adoption of such a document will raise the popularity of our government in the eyes of the public and finally get rid of the notoriety of the Secret Society"
     yellowsand.33.a: "[YSCGetEventCountryLeaderA]"

     yellowsand.34.t: "Choice of Capital"
     yellowsand.34.desc: "It seems that there is finally no threat to the Ming dynasty rule of China and it is time to move the capital with the government to a permanent location. There are two options for this: Beijing and Nanjing. Both of them were capitals during the first Ming rule, both of these options have many supporters as well as opponents, as Beijing is associated with the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty and Nanjing with the republican regime of Chiang Kai-shek"
     yellowsand.34.a: "We're going back to Beijing"
     yellowsand.34.b: "We're going back to Nanjing"
     yellowsand.35.t: "Regent's Removal"
     yellowsand.35.desc: "Regent Chang Yintang's attempt to retain full power under the powerless Emperor Zhu Rongji has led to the expected results - the people of the territories under his control are revolting because of the lost hope for the return of the beautiful times under the Ming Empire. This fact in turn has already undermined the trust of the people around him - if previously loyal to him they were ready to support his ambitious political adventures, now they are ready to sacrifice it, for the sake of preserving their position. In addition, they have gained the support of General Wang Ying, who has joined with his loyalists in our army. All demand that the powers of the regent be transferred to him"
     yellowsand.35.a: "It's better to leave amicably"
     yellowsand.36.t: "Wang Ying is Demanding a Transfer of Authority"
     yellowsand.36.desc: "The regent Chang Yintang's rule proved to be too inept, the situation of the common people deteriorated, all their hopes for the return of the beautiful times under the Ming Empire were undermined, which resulted in numerous riots. This fact has in turn undermined the regent's position - if previously loyal to him they were willing to support his ambitious political adventures, but now they are willing to sacrifice it, for the sake of preserving their position. In addition, they have gained the support of General Wang Ying, who has joined with his loyalists in our army. All demand that the powers of the regent be transferred to him"
     yellowsand.36.a: "Former thug is mow a regent?"
     yellowsand.37.t: "Anti-Regency Conspiracy"
     yellowsand.37.desc: "Our attempt to lead the country to a constitutional monarchy and get rid of the ideology and reputation of the Secret Society has failed - the old members of the Yellow Sand Society, who have retained their strength, have conspired with Commander Wang Ying to forcefully demand that regent Chang Yintang resign and be replaced by Wang Ying himself. Thus, the true “Yellow Sanders” want to return to the old order, since there was apparently no worthy leader among them, and Wang had managed to convince them of his commitment to their ideals"
     yellowsand.37.a: "To preserve his life, the regent had better leave"
     yellowsand.38.t: "Wang Ying's Order"
     yellowsand.38.desc: "Astonishing events unfolded after the regency was handed over to General Wang Ying. Over the next few days, soldiers loyal to Wang Ying personally began to break into the homes of the old members of the Yellow Sand Society, killing and looting them. This continued until everyone who could interfere with Wang Ying ceased to exist. It seems that the former bandit was able to fraudulently gain power. No return to the secret society's ideology is imminent. But that's not what you'd expect from a man who fooled the Japanese."
     yellowsand.38.a: "The new Zhang Zuolin?"
     yellowsand.39.t: "Lee Keaton's Death"
     yellowsand.39.desc: "One of China's first anti-Qing Chinese revolutionaries, Lee Keaton, died in our capital today in his state seat"
