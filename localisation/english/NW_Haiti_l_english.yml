    HAI_bribe_the_media_desc: "It is not enough for us to limit the press in these difficult times after the border massacre. Vincent needs to take care of his image, and to do so, radio and the press must justify our weakness in the conflict with Trujillo."

    HAI_deploy_border_force: "Deploy the Border Force"

    HAI_cancellation_of_the_haitian_concession_desc: "For a long time our country followed the Dominican Republic's lead and agreed to its insolent demands.

    HAI_strengthen_security_of_national_palace_desc: ""The Parsley massacre" significantly destabilized our country and especially the army - the balance formed in the Armed Forces was broken - the Haitian Guard can no longer be considered truly apolitical. In addition, the personal security of the President is now jeopardized. We need to move troops into the capital and increase security of the National Palace in order to reduce the risk of overthrowing the Government."

    HAI_arrest_of_calixta_desc: "As it turned out, General Calixte is behind the incitement of a military coup in the country, apparently sponsored by Trujillo or other foreign forces. Either way, Calixte must be removed from command and arrested to avoid a coup in the country."

    HAI_strengthen_economic_ties_with_united_states_desc: "The United States of America is our country's only partner and ally.

    HAI_invite_instructors_from_marine_corps_desc: "Despite the controversial attitude toward the American occupation of Haiti in our society, the U.S. investment in the nation's infrastructure and military cannot be underestimated.

    HAI_american_defense_of_regime: "America's Defense of the Regime"
    HAI_american_defense_of_regime_desc: "Haiti is the most pro-American State in the region, but at the moment we feel insecure because of external threats and internal instability. Perhaps American protection of the regime can guarantee the security and stability of our state."

    HAI_revival_of_transport_system_desc: "Haiti's economy is directly dependent on the road and transportation infrastructure linking farmland to major cities and ports.

The time has come to launch a program to rebuild Haiti's road network, which dates back to the American occupation."
    HAI_fighting_the_elements: "Fighting the Weather"
    HAI_fighting_the_elements_desc: "Our economy is often damaged by natural disasters: hurricanes, floods and earthquakes are sometimes very destructive, slowing down agricultural development. The creation of new meteorological and seismographic centers, well-functioning evacuation systems, and U.S.-supported humanitarian assistance can help us reduce the threat of natural disasters to the Haitian economy."
    HAI_support_private_initiative: "Support Private Initiative"
    HAI_support_private_initiative_desc: "Our economy is based on the numerous land holdings of wealthy farmers. Perhaps financial support for urban and rural entrepreneurship can bring new finance and innovations to a classic sector of Haiti's economy."
    HAI_start_land_reclamation: "Start Land Melioration"
    HAI_start_land_reclamation_desc: "Only 13% of Haiti's land is fully suitable for agriculture. Our soils are too worn and infertile, and many are on weighty cliffs, making it impossible to grow crops or raise livestock. However, it is possible to increase the amount of fertile land by a program of soil melioration of the main farms of the country. This step is vital to our economy."
    HAI_american_humanitarian_aid: "American Humanitarian Aid"
    HAI_american_humanitarian_aid_desc: "The well-being of Haiti is now largely dependent on foreign aid. In particular, our population is now suffering from famine and outbreaks of epidemics.

    HAI_economic_union_with_america_desc: "Our trade and economic relations with the United States have reached a truly impressive level - America has become our main source of income.

    HAI_innovations_in_agricultural_sector: "Innovations in the Agricultural Sector"
    HAI_innovations_in_agricultural_sector_desc: "One of the reasons for the perniciousness of our agriculture is backward agricultural technology. Until recently, we had no agricultural machinery, fertilizers or other agricultural innovations. Now that foreign expertise and finance have flooded into the country, new agricultural technologies have begun to arrive in Haiti. All that remains is to finally put them to use."
    HAI_cancel_direct_elections: "Abolish Direct Elections"
    HAI_cancel_direct_elections_desc: "The amendments to the constitutional reform of 1935 have only begun to reform the workings of our administration and government. The next step is the abolition of direct parliamentary elections, which will further strengthen President Vincent's powers and end such a useless procedure."
    HAI_leskos_inauguration: "Lescot's Inauguration"
    HAI_leskos_inauguration_desc: "With the resignation of President Vincent, the new leader of the nation is Élie Lescot, who will lead the country forward in a harsh era of impending war. It is now time to finalize Haiti's new course and inaugurate President Lescot."
    HAI_use_trujillos_money: "Use Trujillo's Money."
    HAI_use_trujillos_money_desc: "Dominican dictator Trujillo is backing the newly elected president, hoping to make him his puppet. We will gladly accept his money for the development of Haiti, but Trujillo will not be able to bribe our government this time."
    HAI_strengthen_control_over_state_apparatus: "Strengthen Control over the State Apparatus"
    HAI_strengthen_control_over_state_apparatus_desc: "World tensions are rising ever higher. Gasoline fumes are already in the air.

But we cannot prepare the country for war if we have such limited powers of government."
    HAI_revision_of_guards_administration: "Guard Management Revision"
    HAI_revision_of_guards_administration_desc: "Right now, our military lacks dedicated and loyal government staff. It is worth revising the Guard's management by moving military officers close to the president closer to command."

    HAI_create_rural_police_desc: "It is crucial for us to have a loyal army ready to protect the President from internal enemies.

    HAI_wartime_powers: "Wartime Mandates"
    HAI_wartime_powers_desc: "Now that our nation is at war, it is time for us to begin mobilizing the people and the State to fight the enemy forces. If Haitian sovereignty is to be preserved, martial law must be imposed and presidential powers must be expanded even further."

    HAI_increase_combat_readiness_of_army_desc: "Now that Haiti is at war, it is necessary to train an army not only to protect the regime from internal instability, but also to create a combat-ready force to support allied countries in Asia and Europe. Thankfully, our American ally is ready to provide military assistance to Haiti."
    HAI_fight_against_japan: "War with Japan"
    HAI_fight_against_japan_desc: "The Japanese Empire is attempting to eclipse the greatness of our American ally and has challenged the entire New World by attacking the United States. We must support America in the Pacific campaign."
    HAI_support_allies_in_europe: "Support the Allies in Europe"
    HAI_support_allies_in_europe_desc: "Nazi Germany is a threat to the entire world. Haiti must join the universal struggle against the Nazi monster before it destroys European and American democracies."
    HAI_create_haitian_air_force: "Create a Haitian Air Force"
    HAI_create_haitian_air_force_desc: "The Haitian army still does not have its own air force. Obviously, our armed forces cannot be considered combat-ready until Haiti has its own air force. But thanks to the cooperation of the United States, we can finally put air forces to work."
    HAI_rubber_growing_program: "Rubber Cultivation Program"
    HAI_rubber_growing_program_desc: "Now that our American ally is under a naval blockade in Asia and the Pacific, we have an opportunity to create an alternative to Asian rubber in Haiti, providing America with much-needed wartime rubber.

    HAI_calixtas_coup_desc: "The weakness of President Vincent's political course aroused the growing discontent of the military, which, led by Calixte, staged a coup d'état. Vincent was expelled from the country, and Calixte became the new leader of Haiti, leading it, as his supporters claim, to a return to stability."
    HAI_rise_of_noirism: "The Rise of the Noirists"
    HAI_rise_of_noirism_desc: "As it turned out, the coup against Vincent was only part of the internal struggle of a mulatto elite that had enslaved the Haitian people and sold them out to America and the Dominican Republic.

    HAI_loyalty_of_military: "Military Loyalty"

    HAI_spirit_of_progressivism_desc: "Student support for our movement, coupled with the sympathy of many writers, scholars and cultural figures, makes it a progressivist movement. Our propaganda should focus on the importance of progress for Noirism."

    HAI_form_liberal_coalition_desc: "The Calixte regime is being fought against not only by progressive democrats, but also in the future by potentially dangerous Black racists and communists.

    HAI_alliance_with_voodoo: "An Alliance with Vodou."
    HAI_alliance_with_voodoo_desc: "Calixte, like Vincent, wants to eradicate the Haitian national religion of Vodou. Noirists are ready to stand up in defense of our indigenous beliefs. In fact, many Vodou people themselves are ready to fight against the mulattos."

    HAI_preparation_of_nationalist_cells_desc: "While the Noirist Democrats are trying to defeat Calixte with their rallies and protests, we Black Nationalists need to think about training armed cells within Haiti that will be prepared to do both propaganda and armed combat against the enemy."

    HAI_nation_and_revolution: "Nation and Revolution"
    HAI_nation_and_revolution_desc: "It is time to recognize that the classical internationalist version of Marxism is untenable.

    HAI_end_conflict_with_trujillo_desc: "Ex-President Vincent never reached a resolution to the conflict with the Dominican Republic, keeping the whole country in suspense. Obviously, we need to end the conflict with Trujillo and not make any demands by going to demarcate the border."
    HAI_achieve_american_recognition: "Achieve American Recognition"
    HAI_achieve_american_recognition_desc: "Vincent's regime was firmly tied to the United States. If we do not want to face economic and political problems, we must follow our predecessor and establish friendly relations with America."

    HAI_bases_for_usa_navy_desc: "So, for Haiti to regain its status as a U.S. ally under new leadership, it will not be easy to restore diplomatic relations with the United States. Perhaps providing Haiti's naval bases for the U.S. Navy will help our countries reach a consensus."
    HAI_amendments_to_education_system: "Amendments to the Education System"
    HAI_amendments_to_education_system_desc: "The problem with Haitian education does not seem to lie in wrong government policies at all, but in the lack of sensible selection among college and university students. We need to amend the education system by limiting it to the poor Black population."
    HAI_chasing_voodoo: "Stalking Vodou."
    HAI_chasing_voodoo_desc: "The Negro religion of Vodou is a threat to our Christian society in Haiti. We need to crush this dangerous devil-worshiping tradition so that Haitians can finally become religiously strong and united."

    HAI_entry_of_dominican_troops_desc: "Our experience in fighting terrorists and rioters has shown us that the joint work of Dominican forces and the Haitian police can suppress enemy forces inside the country in a short period of time. It is time for Trujillo to bring his troops into Haiti to guard our allied regime."
    HAI_haitis_new_destination: "Haiti's New Mission"
    HAI_haitis_new_destination_desc: "Our many reforms have made a radical turnaround in Haiti's history - we must now seek the accession of Latin American countries and uphold our European heritage by permanently renouncing ties with Africa. Of course, this turn of events is unlikely to please Black Haitians, but it is necessary for our country."
    HAI_coup_of_noirists: "Noirist Coup"
    HAI_coup_of_noirists_desc: "Calixte's actions have themselves tightened the noose around his regime's neck - the attempt to hand over Haiti's territories to the Dominican Republic was the trigger for the Noirist coup.

    HAI_hold_elections: "Hold an Election"
    HAI_hold_elections_desc: "Now that the Calixte puppet junta is finished, it is time to open the road to democracy for the Haitian people.

    NWhaiti.1.t: "Parsley Massacre"
    NWhaiti.1.desc: "As reported by border forces and fleeing witnesses of the atrocity, the Dominican-Haitian border was the site of a brutal massacre of black and Creole people by Dominican soldiers. The death toll is unknown, but it is clear that more than a thousand Haitians, including women and children, were killed.\n\nOur public is frozen in anticipation of the government's response to Trujillo's actions and the further outcome of a new round of the Haitian-Dominican conflict. Although we have strong political and economic ties with Trujillo, the lack of a decisive response to what has happened will significantly weaken President Vincent's image and lead to a loss of support from the people and the armed forces."
    NWhaiti.1.a: "We need to take action now!"
    
    NWhaiti.2.t: "Calixta's Coup"
    NWhaiti.2.desc: "The weakness shown by President Vincent has resulted in the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy in the ranks of the officers of the Guard, who have nominated Calixta as their leader, the commander-in-chief of the Haitian armed forces.\n\nDespite Calixta's initial pro-Noirist stance, Haitians doubt the integrity of the new ruler, who also belongs to the mulatto elite and has ties to Trujillo. But let's hope that he is the one who will bring back the lost stability to the country."
    NWhaiti.2.a: "Vincent fell victim to his weakness"
    
    NWhaiti.3.t: "Press Restriction"
    NWhaiti.3.desc: "In the wake of public panic following the massacre of Haitians at the Dominican-Haitian border, the Government of President Vincent decided to limit press coverage of the tragedy in order to preserve national calm. In a radio and newspaper address, the President appealed not to destabilize the country at such a difficult time and promised a speedy and peaceful resolution of the conflict. Although the situation has indeed begun to stabilize, support for the government is rapidly declining, with Vincent being accused of political weakness and dependence on Trujillo."
    NWhaiti.3.a: "This is no time for war!"
    
    NWhaiti.4.t: "The Propaganda Campaign Against Trujillo"
    NWhaiti.4.desc: "Despite Vincent's closeness to Trujillo and the political weakness shown before, the current president of Haiti has now announced the beginning of the Haitian people's struggle against the dictatorial regime in the Dominican Republic, promising to bring retribution for the murdered sons of his country. Such statements further destabilize the situation that has unfolded around the Petrouche Massacre, but the people of Haiti have indeed shown support towards their president's decision. The situation is heating up."

    NWhaiti.5.a: "Let's hope for a peaceful outcome"
    
    NWhaiti.6.t: "Compensation to Haiti"
    NWhaiti.6.desc: "It has been more than a month since our soldiers carried out an ethnic cleansing of the country's border regions from Haitians harming the Dominican Republic. But, as we expected, our actions drew a strong negative reaction from the US and shocked the Haitian population. The situation has reached its climax and is waiting to be resolved - in the current negotiations with the Dominican Republic and Haiti, President Vincent is insisting on Dominican compensation for his side and the relatives of the dead Haitians. These demands are backed by American support. Will we agree to US-Haitian terms or make no concessions?"
    NWhaiti.6.a: "We agree to compensate Haiti"
    NWhaiti.6.b: "No concessions to Haitians!"
    
    NWhaiti.7.t: "Dominican Payments"

    NWhaiti.9.a: "Let's strangle them with an embargo!"
    
    NWhaiti.10.t: "American Embargo"
    NWhaiti.10.desc: "Because of our refusal to pay the Haitian contribution and our unwillingness to make concessions to the US-Haitian diplomatic side, the United States Government has declared a trade embargo against us, cutting off supplies to our country. From now on, we will have to look for a new trading partner outside the New World."
    NWhaiti.10.a: "We'll manage without them"
    
    NWhaiti.11.t: "Haiti Pulls Troops to Border"
    NWhaiti.11.desc: "For a long time, President Vincent and his government remained under our protectorate and dared not go against the will of the incomparable Trujillo, but it seems that the Haitian reaction to the border massacre was so ferocious that the Haitian mulatto elite went against us and decided to "restore justice", hoping to force the Dominican Republic to agree to the Haitians' terms. We must be prepared for the outbreak of border conflicts and even war with Haiti, which will no doubt end the divided Espanola forever."
    NWhaiti.11.a: "Pathetic bluff"
    
    NWhaiti.12.t: "Haitian Ultimatum!"
    NWhaiti.12.desc: "The reaction of the Haitian Government to the ethnic cleansing carried out by our troops was surprisingly brazen and arrogant: Vincent decided that he would no longer be Trujillo's puppet and raised his people to fight the "bloody tyrant". And now the game of Vincent the Liberator has reached its climax: Haiti has made demands to the Dominican Republic that require us to make significant territorial concessions to the Haitian side, and to pay a considerable amount of reparations for crimes against Haitians. What will be our response to Haiti?"
    NWhaiti.12.a: "They've signed their own verdict"
    NWhaiti.12.b: "We don't have the strength to fight them off now..."
    
    NWhaiti.13.t: "Trujillo Rejects Our Ultimatum!"
    NWhaiti.13.desc: "As expected, the Dominican leader proved too arrogant and refused to comply with our demands, instead beginning to prepare the country for war. Now we have no turning back - since Trujillo is unable to return to the real world on his own, we will do so by force, ending him and his inhumane regime."
    NWhaiti.13.a: "It's time to defeat our enemies!"
    
    NWhaiti.14.t: "Dominican Republic Makes Concessions"
    NWhaiti.14.desc: "Trujillo proved to be a much weaker ruler than he had positioned himself to be – only when he felt pressure from us, he immediately made concessions and offered no resistance to the Haitian forces when they crossed the border. From now on, we are the dominant force on the entire island."
    NWhaiti.14.a: "We have achieved what is rightfully ours!"
    
    NWhaiti.15.t: "Haiti's Entry into War"
    NWhaiti.15.desc: "The war unfolding in Asia and Europe has reached the New World after the United States of America was attacked from its oceanic possessions by the Japanese Empire. Our Parliament is debating what Haiti's response will be to America's entry into the war – will we support our American allies and sever diplomatic ties with the aggressors, or will we continue to remain neutral? Although we do not have the strength to go to war, a neutral position in this situation could lead to a serious deterioration of relations with the U.S. and limit Haiti's further development."
    NWhaiti.15.a: "We will enter the war on the side of the US"
    NWhaiti.15.b: "It's not in our interest to go to war right now"
    
    NWhaiti.16.t: "Student Protests in Capital"
    NWhaiti.16.desc: "The growing influence and power of the incumbent mulatto president, Elie Lescot, sparked violent anti-government protests in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and Gonaives, led by student noirist movements. Thankfully, the Guards were able to quickly disperse the protest of the dark-skinned youths, but this event showed us how dangerous it is to ignore the issue of internal security. Going forward, we can be even more confident and bold in strengthening the ranks of our police force and promoting loyal personnel to ensure that there is no repeat of this incident."
    NWhaiti.16.a: "What cheeky schoolboys!"
    
    NWhaiti.17.t: "Reduction of Black Officer Commanders"
    NWhaiti.17.desc: "The review of the Haitian Armed Forces high command was followed by a series of changes in the lower ranks – many black officers and soldiers left the Haitian army in protest, and disgruntled NCOs and officers with ties to the Noirism movement and the recent student protests were removed from command. This environment has shaken the state of our army, but we have gotten rid of potential traitors."
    NWhaiti.17.a: "Our army can cope without them!"
    
    NWhaiti.18.t: "Vincent's Resignation"
    NWhaiti.18.desc: "President Stenio Vincent, who had been in office since 1931 and ruled Haiti for 11 years, declined to run for a third term and stepped down before the end of his second, handing power to his Liberal Party adviser, Elie Lescot, who was supported by a majority in parliament. Like his predecessor, Lescot belongs to the country's mulatto elite and enjoys American support.\n\nNevertheless, not all Haitians are happy about the continuation of mulatto rule in the country and the lack of full-fledged democratic elections, which could further inflame racial and social conflict in the country. There are also rumors of Trujillo's financial assistance to the new president. But only time will tell Lescot's true intentions. Let's hope he will lead the country forward, bringing it out of the economic abyss."
    NWhaiti.18.a: "Long live President Lescot!"
    
    NWhaiti.19.t: "$HAI_student_protests$"
    NWhaiti.19.desc: "Restricted access to education for the poor and mass expulsions in the country's universities have led to the start of mass student protests in the country's cities. In some cases we have had to make concessions to the protesting students and allow them to return to their studies, but otherwise our Guard is engaged in suppressing riots. The broad opposition to the regime in the form of youth movements has greatly increased the spread of liberal and Marxist ideas in our society."
    NWhaiti.19.a: "They only confirmed the correctness of our reform!"
    
    NWhaiti.20.t: "Attacks on Churches"
    NWhaiti.20.desc: "Panic has gripped the country as groups of armed terrorists have carried out a series of attacks on Catholic churches across the country, especially mission churches far from the center that were recently built to convert non-Christians to Catholicism. Aggressive supporters of the Voodoo cult have chosen to strike fear into our government in this way, thus showing their willingness to fight against the Calixta regime's eradication of Voodoo.\n\nOn the other hand, our Guard has already begun arresting the terrorists, and the churches have been given funds to make up for the damage. Order will soon be restored."
    NWhaiti.20.a: "Voodoo has shown its true face"
    
    NWhaiti.21.t: "Losing Loyalty of Military"
    NWhaiti.21.desc: "Many military personnel are retiring after we removed a number of black officers from command and reduced the number of Afro-Haitian soldiers in the Guard. Those remaining have committed a number of sabotage and attempted attacks on military depots. Individual groups have deserted to the mountains and forests, hoping to launch guerrilla struggles in the near future. We can no longer deny the growing instability, for we now seem to be losing influence in our own army. Let us hope that soon forces loyal to us will suppress and replace the military that has left."
    
    NWhaiti.22.t: "Protests Against "Second Occupation""
    NWhaiti.22.desc: "According to the Guard Command, our capital has been engulfed by large-scale popular protests caused by the introduction of American forces into the country and the stationing of the US military fleet in the country's ports. Many Haitians see this move by the government as a path to a renewed American occupation of the country. The government has been opposed by ordinary workers, politicians from the Noirist movement, and nationalists who do not want to accept such an obvious American presence in their country. Although the protesters did not achieve anything by their actions, the event undermined national stability."
    NWhaiti.22.a: "Disperse these Traitors!"
    
    NWhaiti.23.t: "Noirist Coup!"
    NWhaiti.23.desc: "Following Calixta's attempt to make significant territorial concessions to the Dominican Republic, the long-simmering discontent of the people of Haiti erupted into a violent wave of popular uprisings led by the Noirists. The National Palace was stormed, the Haitian Guard was disbanded, and a number of laws passed during the Calixta regime were repealed. The era of the mulatto elite rule is finally over in Haiti – the new government is mostly black. Does this mean the beginning of the country's development."
    NWhaiti.23.a: "The yoke of mulatto rule is cast off!"
    
    NWhaiti.24.t: "The Suppression of Noirism Rebellion"
    NWhaiti.24.desc: "After the official announcement of the settlement of the territorial dispute with the Dominican Republic, mobs of rioting and infuriated Noirists made futile attempts to seize the National Palace and proclaimed their coup against Calixta in Gonaives. But the combined forces of the Dominican and Haitian armies were able to bring order to the country, defeating the rioters in the "capital" of the revolution, Gonaives and Porto au Prince. Hundreds of Noirists and their associates have been arrested and killed in street skirmishes. But somehow, we are finally reconciled with our neighbor. Peace and order will soon return to Haiti."
    NWhaiti.24.a: "Finish the survivors"
    
    NWhaiti.25.t: "Haitian Refugee Influx"
    NWhaiti.25.desc: "Political instability in Haiti has led to mass immigration of Haitians to the nearest States with a sizeable black diaspora, including our country.\nAnd while we are doing everything possible to prevent a migration crisis and limit the influx of Haitians, refugees continue to arrive in port cities, sometimes crossing the water on their own on their way to freedom.\nIn all likelihood, Haitian immigration will not subside until the political situation in Haiti returns to normal. One way or another, all we have to do for now is to make sure that the Haitians arrive safely."
    NWhaiti.25.a: "Haiti's problems have spilled over to us as well"
    
    NWhaiti.26.desc: "Mass student protests have engulfed the capital city and Gonaives. The protesters are in favor of abolishing the education reform, under which access to higher education can be granted depending on one's financial situation. The majority of students are also poor black students, who have begun to be expelled en masse due to inability to pay tuition or "failure". Although in some cases the government has made concessions to the protesters, the situation remains unchanged. The Calixta regime has received widespread opposition from the student movement."
    NWhaiti.26.a: "The hour of release is drawing nearer!"
    
    NWhaiti.27.t: "Racially Motivated Mass Riots"
    NWhaiti.27.desc: "The growing influence of the nationalist wing of the Noirists and the formation of their armed groups led to an exacerbation of racial conflict in the country. Eventually, rising tensions culminated in the beginning of pogroms against mulattoes in major cities and rural areas of the country. The attacks primarily targeted wealthy white neighborhoods or the mansions of wealthy mulattos. The Haitian Guard is now working to quell the unrest, but it is already becoming clear that Calixta has a diminishing chance of retaining power."
    NWhaiti.27.a: "Such is the price we pay for the freedom of our people!"
    
    NWhaiti.28.desc: "For months now, the country has been heated by the actions of Calixta and his government. Hundreds of thousands of black Haitians had been disenfranchised by the growing position of a small mulatto elite. This state of affairs led to a sharp rise in the popularity of Noirism and its strands. During Calixta's rule, the noirists were able to prepare a powerful underground base based on loyal military officers, politicians, and workers.\n\nBut eventually the situation got out of control – an attempt to reconcile Haiti with Dominica, initiated by Calixta's government and consisting in territorial concessions to the eastern neighbor, became the spark that led to the beginning of a coup d'état – thousands of ordinary Haitians and Guards occupied the main cities of the country and stormed the National Palace. Calixta was arrested, and the provisional government, in a speech, promised to hold elections in the coming weeks, where a president of the country would be democratically elected."
    NWhaiti.28.a: "At last the dictatorship of Calixta is overthrown!"
    
    NWhaiti.29.t: "Liberal Front Wins Election"
    NWhaiti.29.desc: "As a result of the fierce political struggle that followed the overthrow of the Calixta dictatorship, Haiti's liberal front, represented by the most progressive and democratic wing of Haitian politics, was able to gain the upper hand among the country's ordinary people and win the elections. But only the future will tell whether the time of freedom and democracy is truly coming to Haiti."
    NWhaiti.29.a: "Long live the light of democracy!"
    
    NWhaiti.30.t: "HCP Election Victory"
    NWhaiti.30.desc: "The overthrow of Calixta was only the first step in the liberation of Haitian workers from the oppression of capital – it was the communist forces that fought most vigorously against the defeatist dictator, and now their efforts are echoing in the minds of the people – the HCP won the majority of votes in the last elections. Of course, this situation greatly increases tensions in the region: many fear that the Soviet Union will strengthen the position of the labor movement in Latin America through the hands of Haiti."
    NWhaiti.30.a: "Long live the workers of Haiti!"
    
    NWhaiti.31.t: "NNP Election Victory"
    NWhaiti.31.desc: "Despite all predictions, the outcome of the elections in Haiti turned out in favor of the NNP, the most controversial and radical organization formed after Calixta's coup. Ardent supporters of Voodoo and opponents of Christianity, black racists and representatives of terrorist guerrilla groups are now the new government of the country. Only time will tell what the consequences of the victory of Lorimer and his allies will be for the region."
    NWhaiti.31.a: "All power to black people!"
    
    NWhaiti.32.t: "Haiti is Cutting Political-Military Ties!"
    NWhaiti.32.desc: "The situation in Haiti has become highly destabilized over the past few months, with two consecutive coups in the country, setting the stage for radical changes in Haiti's political life. The recent elections were won by anti-American forces, bringing our interests into conflict with the new Haitian government. In particular, the Haitian government has begun nationalizing US campaigns and severing until recently strong military ties with our Armed Forces. Obviously, this environment means a weakening of American influence in the Caribbean. But what are we willing to do to preserve it?"
    NWhaiti.32.a: "They mean nothing to us"
    NWhaiti.32.b: "Let's see how they fare without our help."
    NWhaiti.32.c: "We must protect our interests... including with weapons"
    
    NWhaiti.33.t: "America is Embargoed!"
    NWhaiti.33.desc: "Our actions have considerably weakened the position of the American forces in the Caribbean region – unwilling to take tough measures, but also unwilling to ignore this state of affairs, Washington has announced the complete severance of trade relations with Haiti and the cessation of any financial and military assistance to the country. From now on, Haiti will continue on its own and without the oversight of the American imperialists. We can only hope that the loss of the American presence will mark the beginning of the dawn of the Haitian nation."
    NWhaiti.33.a: "Haiti can handle itself!"
    
    NWhaiti.34.t: "Party Leadership Issue"
    NWhaiti.34.desc: "During the struggle against the Calixta regime, liberal forces acted together without a clear party hierarchy. Jean Price-Mars, an old-school nationalist, ran as the leader of the liberal party, eventually becoming the country's newly elected president. However, representatives of the younger wing of the democratic movement consider this outcome unfair, demanding that Price-Mars step down in favor of the country's favorite son, Dumarce Estime. So what decision does our new government need to make?"
    NWhaiti.34.a: "Price-Mars is the legitimate president of the country!"
    NWhaiti.34.b: "It's time for Price-Mars to end his political career"
    
    NWhaiti.35.t: "International Exhibition in Port-au-Prince"
    NWhaiti.35.desc: "Thousands of foreign tourists are arriving in Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, to visit the exhibition of Haitian culture on the shores of the Gulf of Gonave, where over the past few months dozens of pavilions representing Haiti's achievements and the flavor of our country's culture have been placed. In addition, exhibits from Guatemala, Argentina, Vatican City, Cuba, Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela have been brought to the Expo. It is obvious that the Exposition will bring us tremendous financial success and help us popularize our culture in America and Europe."
    NWhaiti.35.a: "Let the whole world see our success!"
    
    NWhaiti.36.t: "Communist coup in Haiti!"
    NWhaiti.36.desc: "The Red threat came from a place where it was not expected – after the overthrow of the Calixta dictatorship by elections, the Communists came to power in Haiti, taking the course of cooperation with the Soviet Union and the creation of a powerful military base of the Reds against our country. The new Haitian government has already severed the strong diplomatic, economic and military ties of our nations, deciding to finally sell their national sovereignty to Stalin. The question before the President's Congress is whether the sprout of the Red menace must be eradicated now, or whether the potential danger from Haiti's Communists has been greatly exaggerated."
    NWhaiti.36.a: "We have much more obvious problems"
    NWhaiti.36.b: "We will not allow communism off the shores of America!"
    
    NWhaiti.37.t: "Terrorist Attack in Detroit!"
    NWhaiti.37.desc: "A series of powerful explosions erupted in Detroit's industrial district tonight, igniting fires in several parts of the city and destroying several industrial plants. Dozens of injured and dead city residents are reported as victims of the spreading flames.\n\nThe National Guard cordoned off entrances to the city and imposed a state of emergency to prevent further terrorist attacks in Detroit, but the incident showed the vulnerability of American cities to such sabotage."
    NWhaiti.37.a: "We must catch the culprits!"
    
    NWhaiti.38.t: "Terrorist Attack in New York!"
    NWhaiti.38.desc: "Tonight, a series of powerful explosions erupted in New York City's industrial district, igniting fires in several parts of the city and destroying several industrial plants.\n\nDozens of injured and dead city residents are reported as victims of the spreading flames. The National Guard cordoned off entrances to the city and declared a state of emergency to prevent further terrorist attacks in New York, but the incident showed the vulnerability of American cities to such sabotage."
    
    NWhaiti.39.t: "Black Riots in Louisiana!"
    NWhaiti.39.desc: "Hundreds of armed black militias deployed in several Louisiana cities, smashing industrial plants, gun stores, and police stations, causing tremendous damage to the state's economy and stability. Although the terrorists were quickly eliminated by National Guard forces due to a lack of full organization within their ranks, the Louisiana terrorist attacks caused significant wartime damage to our country."
    NWhaiti.39.a: "We have to find out who's behind this!"
    
    NWhaiti.40.t: "Diversions in California Shipyards!"
    NWhaiti.40.desc: "Hundreds of black shipyard workers in California organized a mass strike, then turned to armed violence under the slogans of racial justice and desegregation of the state. The National Guard was forced to return fire on the rioters. Although the riots were quickly put down, the California strikes did much damage to our shipbuilding industry and stability."
    
    NWhaiti.41.t: "Haitian Accession to Comintern"
    NWhaiti.41.desc: "In a recent coup d'état, progressive communist forces came to power in Haiti with the goal of destroying imperialism and colonialism in the Caribbean and liberating the black peoples of the Americas.\nNow, however, Haiti feels threatened by the United States and hopes that a formal alliance with our nation will help them defend their sovereignty. Are we ready to welcome the Haitian people into our communist commonwealth?"
    NWhaiti.41.a: "We are ready to finance Haitian accession to the Comintern"
    NWhaiti.41.b: "It's not in our best interest"
    
    NWhaiti.42.t: "The Soviet Union Rejects our Application to Comintern!"
    NWhaiti.42.desc: "The government of the Soviet Union has refused to strengthen relations with our nation to the level of a formal military-economic alliance, making it clear to us that the USSR is not interested in fighting America and Britain right now.\nHaiti will have to wage its own anti-imperialist struggle, but we will have to bet on defense against the re-subjugation of our people, not on the liberation of other nations from colonialism."
    NWhaiti.42.a: "It's a stab in the back!"
    
    NWhaiti.43.t: "Racial Unrest in South"
    NWhaiti.43.desc: "The racial tension that has been brewing for the past few months, amid the growing popularity of Marxist associations of black people, has reached its peak and resulted in racial riots that broke out in New Orleans, Birmingham, Miami and a number of other major cities in the American South. White racist organizations were also not left out and began hunting down black revolutionaries.\n\nNow the streets of American cities are in chaos, and we cannot quickly quell the disorder: it will take weeks to restore order."
    NWhaiti.43.a: "We need to restore order as soon as possible"
    
    NWhaiti.44.t: "Black Revolution in South"
    NWhaiti.44.desc: "Racial riots that have engulfed the southern cities of America have been going on for several weeks, but the events that took place today in the main cities of Alabama, Florida and Louisiana are much more serious than just mass pogroms without a clear organization: Harry Haywood and his associates announced at a rally in Birmingham the beginning of the African-American revolution to free the Black Belt territories from the "American occupiers", deploying in the city armed brigades of black revolutionaries. Along with Birmingham, the city of Mobile, which had been taken over by African Americans, joined the black rebellion, and fierce battles broke out between the National Guard and black brigades in Miami and the suburbs of New Orleans.\n\nThere is a high danger of the Soviet Union joining the internal conflict in America and starting a full-fledged war, which is already underway in the urban ghettos."
    NWhaiti.44.a: "We must crush the revolution as soon as possible!"
    
    NWhaiti.45.t: "Issues of Solvency of Haitian Industry"
    NWhaiti.45.desc: "Our cooperation with the Soviet Union is now only continuing to strengthen, but Soviet experts still doubt the soundness of Caribbean industry and the ability of our government to continue building socialism in the region on its own. We have set ourselves the clear objective of demonstrating the ability of Caribbean industry and of strengthening our economy on our own within the next few months."

    NWhaiti.47.t: "Economic Difficulties"
    NWhaiti.47.desc: "In the past months, we have failed to make steady progress in the economic sphere, failing to complete the demonstrative project of strengthening Caribbean industry, driving ourselves deeper into the abyss of dependence on our older socialist brother in Moscow. Of course, the USSR will continue to give us all possible support for the industrialization of the Caribbean region, but this will not help us prove the independence and strength of the Haitian revolutionaries."

    NWhaiti.48.desc: "Historically oppressed and awakened by the spirit of the Black Revolution, the people of Haiti have now defied the entire capitalist-imperialist world that has encircled our bonfire of freedom with its colonies on all sides. But to our Russian allies, such adventurism and sharpness of the Haitian revolutionaries seems far from the most justified due to the lack of a sufficient military-industrial base to equip the red army of the republic – [SOV.GetLeader] must see that Haiti is capable of producing the best weapons for its armed forces!"

    NWhaiti.49.t: "Successes in Military Production"
    NWhaiti.49.desc: "In a very short period of time, we have managed to increase the strength of the Haitian military-industrial complex, proving to Moscow that the Caribbean is capable of independently producing the most necessary weapons for the revolution, even without the help of the Soviet giant. Haiti's military industry will only continue to grow – the consolidation of the military industry of all the liberated countries of the region and the powerful synergy of the fury of the revolutionary strikers await us ahead!"

    NWhaiti.50.t: "Unsatisfactory Reports on MIC"
    NWhaiti.50.desc: "Unfortunately, we have not been able to increase the strength of our independent military-industrial complex over the past months – the rate of arms production has remained at the same level, disproving our claims about Haiti's independence in equipping the revolutionary army of the Caribbean.

    NWhaiti.51.desc: "The leading imperialist powers of the bloody oppressors possess the world's most powerful navy, which we will have to defeat by revolutionary ingenuity in the face of the numerical superiority of the enemy flotillas. The Soviet admirals are extremely doubtful that our Revolutionary Fleet of the Caribbean is ready to fight the American and British sea monsters, recommending that Haiti should not attempt to engage in open combat with the capitalist navy, if only because of the lack of shipbuilding capacity in our republic. The sailors and workers of Haiti must prove to both Moscow and the imperialists that the industriousness of the free revolutionaries of the Caribbean will help us to build the most advanced docks and shipyards in a short time."

The strengthening of the naval potential of the Caribbean bastion of communism clearly shows Moscow and other socialist states that Haiti is a self-sufficient revolutionary force that poses a real threat to France, Great Britain and the United States."

    NWhaiti.55.desc: "The commander-in-chief of our army, General Calixta, today addressed President Vincent with a very depressing report on the current state of the Haitian-Dominican border - Trujillo's soldiers can enter our lands without any problem and without meeting any resistance; moreover, it is difficult to understand where that ill-fated Haitian border basically runs. Calixta proposes to the government to start an urgent reinforcement of the border forces and demands to finance his "Bastion" project, asking for very large fluctuating sums.... Should we support the initiative of the extraordinary commander-in-chief, whose persona is already covered with a lot of rumors, or is there no reason to worry about border security right now?"

But for what purpose did the general go for it? What is the penalty for such sabotage...?"
