 POLITICS_MUSTAFA_KEMAL_ATATURK_DESC: "Mustafa Kemal was not born into the family of a rich official or a high-ranking general, but thanks to his personal determination and proactivity, he became the leader of the Turkish people and prevented the country from being colonised by the Entente countries. However, his policy was never characterized by hatred of Europe — on the contrary, he strived for the Europeanization and modernization of Turkish society and promoted Turkish nationalism. For his service, Mustafa Kemal received the surname Atatürk, Father of the Turks."
 POLITICS_PIERRE_LAVAL_DESC: "Pierre Laval was appointed the Republican Dictator for a good reason: he has always been a strong leader who always knows what to do. His new position has opened a range of opportunities to strengthen state media control that expanded public support for goverment policies. However, the socialists do not particularly enjoy Laval for his support of Mussolini's regime and authoritarian forms of government in general; Laval, in response, does everything possible to defeat left-wing politicians."
 POLITICS_ADOLF_HITLER_DESC: "A private, who made it through the horrors of the First World War, the poverty and political mess of Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, with a rethoric that appealed to the hearts of the Germans. Adolf has reached the position of the absolute leader of the new German Reich and is idolized by his comrades and ordinary Germans. As for non-Germans, the Fuhrer treats them with caution at best, and more often with hatred and a desire to destroy. Critics and opponents of the ruler and his course have disappeared, or will disappear soon. Adolf Hitler, as Germans believe, will ensure the prosperity of the Thousand-Year Reich, no matter how insidious the enemies turned out to be."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_STALIN_DESC: "Having earned the reins of power after Lenin's death and a brief period of internal struggle, Joseph Stalin has led the young Union through unprecedented measures to overcome years of backwardness. He pulled the Soviet Russia, which united around itself a dozen of socialist republics, out of ruin and poverty, and made it one of the most powerful nations on the planet. The Friend, Leader and Teacher of the Soviet people is loved and respected, even if his paranoia has become noticeable, and his vanity has grown. Millions of Soviet citizens, however, praise the Father of Nations and do not notice this, carrying on being confident in the loyalty of Joseph Vissarionovich course, which he leads the USSR."

 POLITICS_REZA_SHAH_PAHLAVI_DESC: "Having declared himself the Shahanshah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi modernized his homeland into an advanced regional power. He actively carried out new reforms, destroying the old way of life: under his rule, the political parties formed, the national identity grew, and the clergy influence weakened. According to the monarch, only great people like Reza Shah Pahlavi and Adolf Hitler were capable of such reforms. Pahlavi believes in a bigger role of Hitler in the formation of the Iranian economy. But, in any case, these facts could not overshadow the past of Reza Shah, who used to head the Cossack brigade - after all, he still pays special attention to army needs."

A successful industrialist and a Commissioner of Monrovia, he did a lot for the region hoping to make an industrial breakthrough. He gathered like-minded people around him, but lost the election against Charles King, however there is little doubt that the election itself is corrupt in human history. After losing the next election, he opposed the entire Whig government, exposing slavery to the League of Nations, but international community did nothing. Only with the support of Juah Nimley, he was able to achieve a positive result and win new elections, launching a full industrialization."

 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC: "Herman Göring came from a famous family. His father, Heinrich Göering, was a personal friend of Otto von Bismarck and a Governor-General of German Southwest Africa Ernst. But Herman himself didn’t fall short: during the Great War, he was an adjutant of an infantry battalion and later became a fighter pilot. Herman Göering has proven himself to be a fearless aviator, often neglecting the danger of death. In 1922, Göering met Adolf Hitler and became actively involved in the Nazi movement. Göering also participated in the Beer Hall Putsch attempt, when was seriously wounded. Since then, he lived in Austria, Italy, and Sweden; at the same time Goering developed an addiction to morphine, which caused a mental disturbance. After his recovery and return home, he became politically active, being de facto the second man in the party after Hitler. He was involved in the creation of the air force of the Reich — the Luftwaffe. Unlike his party comrades, he is not so radical in his views and is not subject to Nazi ideology. As a result, he often goes against racial laws and is also ready to compromise with other political forces."
 POLITICS_HEINRICH_HIMMLER_DESC: "Heinrich Himmler graduated from the Higher Technical School of Munich with a degree in Agronomy. In August 1923, Himmler joined the NSDAP with party number 14303 and took part in an unsuccessful attempt by the Nazis to seize power in Munich, known as Beer Hall Putsch. Frustrated by his failures, Himmler became irritable, aggressive, and opinionated, alienating himself from both friends and relatives. His new religion became Germanic mythology, supplemented with elements of the occult. The political aspect of his view of the world was in line with the program of the Nazis. Initially, Himmler was not fond of Hitler and did not share Adolf’s personality cult. Later, however, Himmler came to regard the Führer as useful for the role of party figure. In September 1927, Heinrich Himmler voiced to Hitler the idea of transforming the SS into a powerful racially pure, and unconditionally loyal fighting unit. In 1929, by the order of Adolf Hitler, he was appointed Reichsfuhrer of the SS. Himmler created in the SS a cult of ancestors — which, however, went beyond the organization — to maintain the purity of the race and the myth of the immortality of the German people."
 POLITICS_CARL_FRIEDRICH_GOERDELER_DESC: "Friedrich Goerdeler was born into the family of a Prussian civil servant. Like his three brothers, he received a law degree from the University of Tübingen and the University of Königsberg. In 1919, he acted as a political mediator at the headquarters of the 17th Army Corps. In 1920, he joined the right-wing German National People’s Party and remained a member until 1931. In 1920-1930, he was the second mayor of Königsberg and later served as the Lord Mayor of Leipzig. As a municipal figure, Friedrich Goerdeler paid much attention to saving the city budget, strictly balancing the revenues and expenditures, and striving for an increase in labor productivity. In 1932, the retiring Reich Chancellor Heinrich Bruning recommended Goerdeler as his successor, but his candidacy was rejected by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg. Initially, he was sympathetic to the Nazis coming to power, believing that only hard power can stabilize the political and socio-economic situation in the country. By the mid-1930s, however, there were growing differences between Goerdeler and the Nazis - in particular, he was a monarchist and had a negative view of their economic, racial, and ecclesiastical policies. He was a natural-born organizer, an able orator, and a writer. A warm-hearted and humane man at heart, Goerdeler was an unwavering believer in the necessity of adhering to strict puritan moral principles. Perhaps that is why he lacked warmth in his dealings with people. He is by nature a true autocrat, a leader confident in his views, which enables him to easily persuade weak or wavering people to adopt his point of view and follow him."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_III_DESC: "Wilhelm III, the heir to the German Imperial throne, was born on May 6, 1882, at the Marble Palace in Potsdam to the future German Emperor Wilhelm II of  Hohenzollern. During the Great War, Wilhem III personally commanded a group of armies on the Western Front, but in the November armistice, Crown Prince was forced to resign and settle in exile in Osterland on the island of Virgen in the Netherlands together with his father. Five years later, he received permission to live in Germany and settled on his estate near Potsdam. In 1932, Wilhem III attempted to run for the presidency but failed to obtain his father’s permission. Consequently, he rallied behind Adolf Hitler and publicly supported the National Socialists, and urged his father to declare his sympathies for the Führer. Hitler, on his side, had convinced Wilhelm that he saw «the restoration of the monarchy as the crowning achievement of his aspirations». The Nazis took advantage of this trust and used it to their advantage, calling Wilhelm III «an idiot and a fool» among themselves. At the same time, Wilhelm III remained in deference to parts of the military who wanted to restore the monarchy, but considered the Nazis too radical in their political program."

In 1914, he morganatically married Ina Marie von Bassewitz, so his children are excluded from the royal line of succession. A Great War veteran, he was awarded the wound badge for his injuries. After the war, he became interested in military unions, and in 1927 he became a Master of Knights, Protestant Order of Saint John.

In 1928, Moltke became involved with college teachers and youth movement leaders in the organization of the Löwenberg working groups in which unemployed young workers and young farmers were brought together with students so that they could learn from one another. He opposed National Socialism ideology because of his moral and religious beliefs, and in 1935 he declined the chance to become a judge to avoid having to join the Nazi Party. Instead, he opened a law practice in Berlin. As a lawyer, he helped the victims of Hitler’s régime."
 POLITICS_KONRAD_ADENAUER_DESC: "Konrad Adenauer was born in Cologne, Rhenish Prussia, on 5 January 1876. At the age of 18, he volunteered to join the army, where he served for 15 years. In 1906 he joined Zentrum and was elected to Cologne’s city council in the same year. In 1932, he became the president of the Prussian State Council. At first Adenauer, as a mayor of Cologne, believe that it was possible to find allies in Nazism in a joint fight against communism, but Adenauer finally realized the futility of any attempts at compromise with the Nazis. On 4 April 1933, he was officially dismissed as mayor and his bank accounts were frozen. During the next two years, Adenauer changed residences often for fear of reprisals against him, while living on the benevolence of friends. He remains on the opponent of the Nazi regime but is no friend of communists either."

He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1903, and later he became a member of the Central Union of Trade, transport, and traffic workers of Germany and ascended to the chairman of the ‘Department carters’. In late October 1918, while on home leave from the front, Thälmann deserted from the army and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. Thälmann helped to organize the Hamburg Uprising of October 1923, whose failure forced Thälmann was forced to go into hiding. In February 1925 he became chairman of the KPD’s paramilitary organization, the Roter Frontkämpferbund and later this year Thälmann headed the KPD and thus a candidate for the German Presidency. Thälmann’s candidacy in the second round of the presidential election split the center-left vote, ensuring that the conservative Paul von Hindenburg defeated the Centre Party’s, Wilhelm Marx. In March 1932, Thälmann was once again a candidate for the German Presidency, against the incumbent Paul von Hindenburg and Hitler. The KPD’s slogan was «A vote for Hindenburg is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war». After the National Socialists came to power in January 1933, Thälmann proposed that the SPD and KPD should organize a general strike to topple National Socialist rule together. By that time, however, National Socialists had risen to power and the KPD had been largely destroyed."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_PIECK_DESC: "Willhelm Pieck has been drawn to socialist ideas since he was a teenager — in 1894 Pieck joined the woodworkers’ federation, which steered him towards joining the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) the following year. Pieck became the chairman of the party’s urban district in 1899, and in 1906 became full-time secretary of the SPD. During the Great War, although the majority of the SPD supported the German government, Pieck was a member of the party’s left wing, which opposed the war, what led to his arrest and detention in a military prison. Upon his return to Berlin in 1918, Pieck joined the newly founded Communist Party of Germany (KPD). On 16 January 1919 Pieck, along with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, was arrested while meeting at Berlin Eden Hotel. While the two were murdered, Pieck managed to escape.

Upon the election of Friedrich Ebert as Reich President on 11 February 1919, he acted as presiding officer of the SPD and was formally elected chairman on 14 June. In 1920, Wels organized the general strike that helped defeat the right-wing Kapp Putsch. After the Preußenschlag of July 1932 against Otto Braun’s government in the Free State of Prussia, he spoke against a general strike, but after the Reichstag election of November 1932, he rejected any negotiations with the new chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher. On 23 March 1933 Wels was the only member of the Reichstag to speak against Adolf Hitler’s Enabling Act. Speaking directly to Hitler, Wels proclaimed, «You can take our lives and our freedom, but you cannot take our honor. We are defenseless but not honourless»."
 POLITICS_WERNER_VON_BLOMBERG_DESC: "Werner von Blomberg has had a promising career. He joined German General Staff in 1908 and proudly served the Empire, earning him a Pour le Mérite for his heroism during the Great War. When the monarchy was abolished and the Empire transformed into a republic, he was appointed chief of staff of the Stuttgart Army Area and later was promoted to chief of the Troop Office, serving as a de-facto Military Minister. However, he has never been a proponent of democracy — in 1928, Blomberg visited the Soviet Union, where he was much impressed by the high status of the Red Army, and left a convinced believer in the value of totalitarian dictatorship as the prerequisite for military power. He welcomed Nazi Party accession, and much to Hitler’s satisfaction, he became a Reichsminister of Defence, and later rose to the ranks of Reichsminister of War & Wehrmacht Commander-in-Chief. His future looks bright, but it’s no doubt that he has also made enemies along the way."
 POLITICS_LUDWIG_BECK_DESC: "In 1933, upon witnessing the Nazi Machtergreifung, Ludwig Beck wrote, «I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918». He took the German defeat in the Great War very personally, he despised the Entente for dismantling his Homeland, and throughout all his command appointments in the Weimar republic, he hoped that revenge will come. Ludwig Beck never aligned himself with Nazi ideology, hell, he even expressed his skepticism over Hitler on several occasions. However, he believed that it was the NSDAP rule only that can restore the German glory. General Beck became a Chief of the General Staff of the German Army High Command, hoping that it will be him who avenge the errors of the past. The only problem is that he is not the only one."
 POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC: "Wilhelm II has already proven that he won’t be an ordinary monarch. After all, how many emperors have been named war criminals and the main instigators of the greatest war in the history of mankind? In a span of 10 years, he lost his country, his people, his family, and even his respect. Thank god for Wilhelmina - who knows where he would have been if not for her firm determination to let the former German emperor and the Royal family stay. He spend his exile time without any hope of ever return to the throne, but perhaps, history is not over yet."
 POLITICS_OTTO_STRASSER_DESC: "If anyone will ever say that Otto Strasser is not a real National Socialist, this person is a fool! The difference is that he’s more occupied with the «Socialist» part. A former activist of the Nazi Party, he resigned in 1930 so that to not be expelled. That same year, he formed a Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists, a political group that truly embodied his views. Due to his displeasure with the NSDAP, he was exiled to Czechoslovakia. Guess they were just afraid of Strasserism — a more radical, mass-action, and worker-based form of the ideology to achieve a national rebirth. His time will come, and true caring, and strong Germany will rise again to exterminate its enemies."
 POLITICS_ERNST_NIEKISCH_DESC: "Ernst Niekish, the most famous National Bolshevik in Germany, started his career in the ranks of Social Democrats in 1917. Unfortunately, he was so vehemently opposed to the Dawes Plan, the Locarno Treaties, and the general pacifism of the SPD that he was expelled in 1926. In his journal Widerstand (Resistance), he praised the Soviet Union as a continuation of both Russian nationalism and the old state of Prussia. He also believed in the necessity of a German-Soviet alliance against the «decadent West» and the Treaty of Versailles. The attempt to combine ultranationalism and communism, two extreme ends of the political spectrum, caused Niekisch’s National Bolsheviks to be a force with little support. Although anti-Jewish and in favor of a totalitarian state, Niekisch rejects Adolf Hitler, who he feels lacked any real socialism, and Niekisch instead looks up to Soviet Russia and the industrial development of the Soviet Union as his model for the Führerprinzip."
 POLITICS_JULIUS_LEBER_DESC: "Julius Leber has joined the German Social Democratic Party in 1913 and was twice wounded during the Great War. After the war, he enlisted in the Reichswehr. In 1920, during the Kapp Putsch, he took the Weimar Republic’s side. He soon resigned, as most commanders of the Reichswehr participated in the putsch or sympathized with it to some extent. From 1921 to 1933, he was a member of parliament in Lübeck, in 1924-1933, he was a member of the Reichstag, where he was primarily engaged in defense issues. On 31 January 1933, the NSDAP, the SA, the SS, the Steel Helm and the State Military Union held a torchlit procession in Lübeck on the occasion of Hitler’s rise to power. This provoked clashes between the Nazis and the police guarding them on the one hand and the Social Democratic paramilitary organization Reichsbanner (led by Leber in this city) and other anti-Nazi forces on the other. After this Leber was arrested, but was soon released on the demand of the workers of Lübeck. In March 1933, he was arrested again, despite his parliamentary immunity. He was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment on the charge of being the ‘mastermind’ for the murder of a Nazi."
 POLITICS_KURT_SCHUMACHER_DESC: "Karl Schumacher, Kurt Schumacher’s father, was a merchant and liberal politician, a city councilman for the German Freedom Party. Despite his bourgeois family influence, Kurt had been imbued with the ideas of Social Democracy in the revisionist interpretation of Eduard Bernstein since his youth. He was also interested in the legacy of Lassalle and Marx. Schumacher combined internationalism and social democracy with German national patriotism. The day after the outbreak of the First World War, Kurt Schumacher volunteered for the army of the German Empire. He fought on the Eastern front, took part in the battle of Łódź; on December 2, 1914 he was seriously wounded, which led to the amputation of his right arm. He was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class and demobilized. While still in training, on January 8, 1918, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He advocated the participation of the working class and Social Democracy in public affairs, the strengthening of national defense (especially in the East), and against the strike movement in wartime. In 1920, Kurt Schumacher arrived in Stuttgart, where he headed the editorial board of the local Social Democratic newspaper Schwäbische Tagwacht. He acted as a convinced and active opponent of the Communist and Nazi parties. He formed and led in Stuttgart the Reichsbanner, a paramilitary militia of Social Democrats against the Communist Roth Front and the Nazi SA. Kurt Schumacher was elected to the Landtag in 1924, and from 1928 was head of the SPD organization in Stuttgart. In the election to the Reichstag on 20 May 1928, Schumacher was a few votes short, but in 1930 he was still elected to the Reichstag. In 1932, 37-year-old Kurt Schumacher became the youngest member of the national SPD leadership. As a socialist, Schumacher was in consistent opposition to the Brüning, Papen and Schleicher cabinets, and as a democrat he stood up to the NSDAP and the SPD. In a parliamentary speech on February 23, 1932, Kurt Schumacher called Hitler’s propaganda «appeal to swine» and «mobilization of stupidity». In August 1932 he became a member of the SPD faction leadership."

 POLITICS_IMAM_YAHYA_DESC: "Imam Yahya has ruled Yemen since 1918, simultaneously holding the title of king and imam. His theocratic rule relies on the support of tribes adhering to the Zeidite version of Shiism, which displeases Sunni Shafia and Shiite Ismailis living in the south and west of the country. The Imam is highly suspicious of foreign influence and has adopted a policy of isolation from the outside world. He once said: «I would rather that my people and I remain poor and eat straw than let foreigners in, or give them concessions, no matter what advantage or wealth might result from their presence». However, Imam Yahya’s motivation is more patriarchal than tyrannical; he believes that as a descendant of Muhammad, he has to protect the Imamate from the corrupting influence of modernity.\n\nImam Yahya, like all members of the Hamidaddin dynasty, one of the branches of the ancient Rashid family, bears the honorific title Sayyid, which denotes that the Imam belongs to the generally recognized descendants of the Prophet. Descent from Muhammad increases Yahya’s authority and the legitimacy of his rule."

Appointed prime minister after the death of his predecessor Tsengeltijn Zhigzhidjav, who was repressed for his "leftist bias". Genden, who survived the purge (and himself sanctioned the Lhumbe affair), pursued a more moderate policy reminiscent of the Soviet NEP, but at the same time objected to the stationing of Soviet troops in the MNR, as he realized that this would finally place Mongolia in a status of dependence on Moscow. In addition, Genden honors Buddha along with Lenin as one of the "greatest geniuses of the Earth" and therefore opposes repression of the Buddhist clergy."

Since his exile, the Dalai Lama has never been able to return to his home monastery and country, but through his connections with many Chinese politicians and the Kuomintang party, he has gained influence in Asia. His rank allowed him to take a ruling role in another Buddhist country, Mongolia, which both the Bolsheviks in the early 20s and the Chinese authorities tried to take advantage of. In addition, even Japanese military officers and spies tried to establish links with him. Panchen-Lama's popularity was so great that it was his arrival that the Arats who rebelled in Mongolia in 1932-1933 hoped for, as they lacked a leading, unifying figure. However, all these political intrigues and struggles undermined Panchen's health and many believe that his days are numbered."

The family was not rich and had only twenty sheep, four cows and two horses. The reincarnation of Dilov-hutukhta among forty other children matching his features was recognised in five-year-old Zhamsranjav Narovanchin-hutukhta - these two khubilgans traditionally lived in Narovanchin-hyid and identified each other in turn. From the age of five, Zhamsranjav moved to the monastery and began to learn the Tibetan language and to learn Buddhist texts by heart.

There, hiding under the names "Lieutenant Zhamsran" and "Gun", he began to play a double game, establishing contact with both the Republic of China and Generalissimo Chiang Kaishi personally, and with the Japanese military from the Kwantung Army and Prince Demchindonrov. He met with Panchen Lama IX, telling him about life in Outer Mongolia, and made a visit to Tibet, where he participated in the determination of the Khubilgan of Bogdo Gegen IX, becoming his "regent"."

In 1924, he became actively involved in politics by joining the coalition of conservatives and liberals, but a year later he fled to Mexico, due to the coup of General-President Chamorro, who eventually resigned without gaining recognition from the United States. However, the uprising of liberal soldiers in Puerto Cabezas gave him a unique opportunity, and he created a government there, securing the rights of a constitutional president.

De facto, since the 1910s, he became the leader of the right-wing movement, leading the nationalists, which is proved by the shoe incident, when he was able to defend to the colonialists the opinion that everyone entering a Buddhist temple should take off their shoes, despite their position in the colonial government.

Однако японский Кабинет не согласился с армией, полагая, что Маньчжурский инцидент был результатом заговора офицеров. Не получив санкции Императора, Хаяси в тот же день приказал бригаде покинуть Маньчжурию. Но в итоге разрешение на её выдвижение в Маньчжурию было дано 22 сентября. После службы в Корее Хаяси в 1932—1934 годах был Генеральным инспектором боевой подготовки и членом Высшего военного совета. Долгое время генерал Хаяси был сторонником фракции Кодоха в армии и поддерживал идеи генерала Садао Араки, однако, когда его самого назначили на пост министра в 1934 году, после ухода Араки в отставку, Хаяси резко переменил своё мнение и фактически перешёл на позиции только что образовавшейся в армии фракции Тосейха. Так, именно он продвинул полковника Нагату Тэцудзан на пост начальника Бюро по военным вопросам, приказал ему подготовить программу эксплуатации ресурсов Маньчжурии и Монголии и всеобщей мобилизации, а также помог ему опубликовать Армейский памфлет.

В 1924 году он занял должность министра армии и стал проводить сокращение её численности, чтобы потратить высвободившиеся финансы на её модернизацию: закупку авиации, танков и оснащение радиостанциями. За это время также сумел сформировать собственную фракцию офицеров, построенную на лояльности лично ему, как это и делали его предшественники на посту министра армии. Однако сокращение армии вызвало протесты со стороны офицеров и привело к отставке Угаки. Через два года, в 1929-м году Угаки снова стал министром армии — в кабинете Хамагути Осати, и на этом посту оказался замешан в мартовском инциденте – попытке группы военных совершить госпереворот.

С началом 30-х Коноэ выдвинулся на первый план политической жизни страны, однако не слишком активно участвовал в борьбе за власть: прямой потомок Фудзивара, некогда всесильных регентов при императорах, с которыми Коноэ состояли в кровном родстве, вероятно, считал, что власть принадлежит ему по праву рождения. Председательство в палате пэров вполне устраивало его. Однако, престарелый гэнро Сайондзи продолжал верить, что Коноэ сможет заменить его после смерти в роли «защитника императорского дома». В 1934 году он посетил США с частным визитом (по поводу поступления его сына в Принстонский университет), где также встретился с президентом Рузвельтом, бывшим президентом Гувером и ещё несколькими представителями высшей американской власти."

В студенческие годы он записался добровольцем в армию и участвовал в японо-китайской войне 1894—1895 годов. После победы Абэ окончил Военную академию Императорской армии, потом Высшую военную академию. Генерал Араки Садао учился с ним в одном классе. С 1918 по 1921 годы Абэ был командующим Третьего артиллерийского полка. Полк был послан в Россию в ходе Гражданской войны, но не принимал участия в боевых действиях. В 20-е годы примкнул к фракции генерала Угаки. В 1932 году Абэ стал генералом армии и главнокомандующим Тайваньской армии."
 POLITICS_MITSUMASA_YONAI_DESC: "Мицумаса Ёнай родился 2 марта 1880 года в городе Мориока префектуры Иватэ. Он был первым сыном в семье бывшего вассала самурайского рода Намбу. В 1901 году он закончил военную академию Императорского флота Японии в Этадзиме, став 68-м по успеваемости среди 115 кадетов. В 1913 году был послан в Петроград в качестве заместителя военно-морского атташе. Ёнай хорошо знал русский язык, и считал Россию потенциальным союзником Японии в предстоящем противостоянии с США и Великобританией. После Октябрьской революции был отозван назад в Японию, где стал старшим помощником командира на броненосце «Асахи». Ёнай поддерживал заключение Лондонского морского договора. Таким образом он вошёл с состав Фракции Договора и подвергся нападкам со стороны «ястребов» на флоте, как и его близкий друг Исороку Ямамото. Он является любителем алкоголя и может его пить в очень больших количествах, сохраняя трезвость. Инцидент 26 февраля он встретил у своей любовницы, в двух кварталах от места событий, но не подозревал о происходящем. Когда он вернулся на свою военно-морскую базу, то одним из первых назвал мятежников «повстанческими солдатами», мобилизовал морскую пехоту и заявил императору о своей лояльности ему, за что заслужил большое доверие с его стороны. Будучи министром военно-морского флота, Ёнай был известен как немногословный человек. Его речи, как правило, были короткими и произносились с почти неразборчивым акцентом намбу. Письменные записи его выступлений составляют лишь половину от речей его современников."
 POLITICS_JINZABURO_MASAKI_DESC: "Масаки родился в префектуре Сага в 1876 году в семье фермера среднего класса. Пожелав стать «великим человеком» и под влиянием победы в китайско-японской войне 1895 года, он пошёл в армию. Масаки окончил Академию императорской армии в 1897 году и был отправлен на фронт во время Русско-японской войны в феврале 1904 года. Однако он нашёл войну очень травмирующим опытом, и после своего возвращения в Японию Масаки подумывал об увольнении из армии и принятии буддийского сана. С мая 1911 года он провёл три года в Германии в звании майора и изучал прусскую армию в качестве рядового солдата. Во время пребывания там он очень заинтересовался философией Ницше, которая оказала большое влияние на последующие взгляды Масаки. В это время он задумался о реконструкции японской армии. Он пришёл к выводу, что для достижения этой цели необходимо положить конец господству фракции Тесю (доминированию в руководстве армии выходцев из региона Тесю). Кроме того, после 1916 года у него сложились хорошие отношения с молодыми офицерами, так как он был противником введения «контроля за мыслями» курсантов, и всегда был готов выслушать их проблемы. Возглавляя военную академию в 1923-1927 годах он заработал хорошую репутацию у выпускников тех лет – именно они стали боевой силой инцидента 26 февраля. Однако, из-за идеологических разногласий с другими офицерами и попыток удержаться у власти в 1934-1935 годах Масаки нажил себе множество врагов, а также о нём сложилась плохая репутация при Императорском дворе."
 POLITICS_NARUHIKO_DESC: "Нарухико родился в 1887 году и был девятым сыном принца Куни Асахико. Как младший сын императорской семьи, он должен был быть понижен до статуса простолюдина и стал бы графом по достижении совершеннолетия. Однако в качестве особого исключения, чтобы обеспечить мужа для принцессы Сатоко, девятой дочери императора Мэйдзи, ему был пожалован титул принца Хигасикуни в возрасте 19 лет в ноябре 1906 года и разрешено создание отдельной ветви Императорского дома. В ноябре 1914 года он окончил Военную академию армии. С апреля 1920 года по 1926 год он учился во Франции в Военной академии Сен-Сир, а после окончания изучал широкий круг предметов, включая политику и дипломатию, в Политехнической школе Парижа. Во время своего пребывания за границей он привык к свободной французской атмосфере, подружившись с художником Клодом Моне, беря у него уроки живописи, а также с бывшим премьер-министром Жоржем Клемансо и героями Первой мировой войны маршалами Жозефом Жоффром и Филиппом Петеном. Он также любил водить автомобили и проводить время со своей местной возлюбленной, от которой у него возможно был ребёнок. В результате своего времени обучения за границей он стал известен как один из самых либеральных мыслителей в императорской семье. Нарухико выразил желание отказаться от своего королевского статуса, ещё находясь во Франции, но в итоге после череды скандалов он вернулся к военной службе на родине в 1927 году."

В детстве он рос со старшим братом, принцем Мицуномией, и младшим братом, принцем Нобухито, и ладил с обоими братьями, которые были примерно одного возраста. Он был самым энергичным из них, и его часто сравнивали со старшим братом, который был всего на год старше его. Он часто дрался с ним из-за игрушек и часто нападал первым. Однако, когда брата не было рядом, он был робким и вспоминает, что был «трусом дома». В декабре 1928 года он поступил в Военную академию армии и окончил её в ноябре 1931 года. С 23 ноября 1931 года он служил командиром роты в 3-м пехотном полку 1-й дивизии, где младшими офицерами служили представители фракции Кокутай Генри-ха. Они стали близкими друзьями, после чего они познакомили его с идеологом истинного социализма Икки Китой. В 1932 году Ясухито в разговоре со старшим братом потребовал от него введения прямого правления и проведения реформ согласно идеям Киты, что вызвало конфликт между братьями, после чего Ясухито отправили командовать в другую дивизию, подальше от Токио и молодых офицеров."
 POLITICS_HIDEKI_TOJO_DESC: "Хидэки Тодзё родился в Токио 30 декабря 1884 года и был третьим сыном Хидэнори Тодзё, генерал-лейтенанта армии, а его мать была дочерью буддийского священника, что делало его семью очень уважаемой, но бедной. В детстве Тодзё был известен своим упрямством, отсутствием чувства юмора и упорством в достижении своих целей. Он был самоуверенным и воинственным юношей, любившим ввязываться в драки с другими мальчиками. В японских школах эпохи Мэйдзи царила жесткая конкуренция, где не было традиции сочувствия к неудачникам, из-за чего учителя часто издевались над ним. Те, кто знал его в годы юности, считали его человеком среднего интеллекта. Однако было известно, что он компенсировал замеченную нехватку интеллекта готовностью очень усердно работать. Героем детства Тодзё был сёгун 17-го века Токугава Иэясу, который издал указ: «Избегай того, что тебе нравится, и обрати свое внимание на неприятные обязанности». Тодзё любил говорить: «Я всего лишь обычный человек, не обладающий блестящими талантами. Всем, чего я достиг, я обязан своей способности упорно трудиться и никогда не сдаваться». Тодзё хвастался, что его единственным увлечением была работа, и он обычно приносил домой документы, чтобы работать до поздней ночи, и отказывался принимать какое-либо участие в воспитании детей, считая это и отвлечением от работы, и женским долгом. Он поручил жене выполнять всю работу по уходу за детьми. Суровый, лишённый чувства юмора человек, он был известен своей резкостью, одержимостью этикетом и холодностью. Как и почти все японские офицеры того времени, он регулярно давал пощёчины своим подчиненным, отдавая приказы. Он говорил, что пощёчины были «средством обучения» мужчин, которые происходили из семей, не принадлежавших к касте самураев, и для которых бусидо не было второй натурой. Хотя это правда, что интеллект Тодзё нельзя недооценивать, на самом деле его прозвали «бритвой» за то, насколько строго он придерживается военной иерархии и подчинения."
 POLITICS_YOSUKE_MATSUOKA_DESC: "В 1880 году Есукэ родился в маленькой рыболовецкой деревне Муродзуми в префектуре Ямагути. Ёсукэ был не по годам развитым ребенком, сообразительным, который не терпел, чтобы на него смотрели свысока. По словам директора его начальной школы, он любил ставить учителей в неловкое положение, задавая вопросы, на которые не было готовых ответов. В 1892 году он был отправлен в японскую общину в США, штат Орегон, где прожил следующие 10 лет, закончив местный университет и хорошо узнав нрав сурового края – региона лесопилок и железных дорог. Там же он принял христианство. Мацуоку можно назвать самым известным японцем в мире, после собственно императора, так как именно он представлял Японию в Лиге Наций в 1933 году во время обсуждения проблемы Маньчжурии, и громко выведя свою делегацию прямо из зала заседаний. При этом его громкий уход из Лиги вызвал восторг японской общественности, но вызвал презрение политических элит страны. Чтобы воспользоваться властью масс, Мацуока подал в отставку из парламента в феврале 1933 года. После этого он сформировал свой «Молодёжный корпус», организацию схожую с итальянскими чернорубашечниками, в рамках запущенного им движения за роспуск политических партий. Когда корпусу не удалось выдвинуть его на пост премьер-министра, японские военные предложили ему пост президента Южно-Маньчжурской железной дороги, однако передача всех активов, включая сотрудников, правительству Маньчжоу-Го года серьёзно подорвала независимость железнодорожной компании. Поняв, что компания лишилась своей власти, Мацуока подал в отставку с поста президента и некоторое время пребывал в политической неопределенности, однако свадьба его дочери восстановила его положение в японской элите."

Накадзима учился в Императорском японском военно-морском инженерном училище. 27 октября 1911 года он пилотировал первый в Японии дирижабль. В том же году он получил звание лейтенанта Императорского японского флота. После окончания Военно-морского штабного колледжа в 1912 году он был отправлен для дальнейшего обучения в Соединенные Штаты, где стал третьим японцем, получившим лицензию пилота после окончания летной школы, основанной Гленном Кёртиссом. Вернувшись в Японию, он спроектировал усовершенствованную версию поплавкового самолета «Фарман» для Императорского флота Японии. В 1916 году Накадзима был отправлен военным атташе в Европу, чтобы лично наблюдать за применением самолётов в бою. По возвращении в Японию в 1917 году он ушёл в отставку из армии в звании лейтенанта и открыл компанию по производству самолётов в Японии, в своём родном городе Ота префектуры Гумма. Накадзима получил финансовую поддержку от коллеги-инженера Сэйбея Каваниси, но в 1919 году партнёрство закончилась, и компания получила название Nakajima Aircraft Company, и в том же году новая компания получила свой первый заказ на 20 самолётов от японских военных. Накадзима впервые баллотировался на государственную должность на всеобщих выборах 1930 года, когда он был избран в Нижнюю палату парламента Японии при поддержке политической партии Риккен Сэйюкай. В 1931 году он передал управление авиастроительной компанией своему брату, чтобы полностью посвятить себя политике, и впоследствии четыре раза переизбирался по избирательному округу Гунма. За это небольшое время вокруг него в партии сформировалась своя собственная фракция, правда выросшая из-за двух факторов: на антагонизме части рядовых членов партии к текущим коррумпированным лидерам Судзуки-Хатояме, а также на том, что постепенно Накадзима стал одним из ключевых финансовых спонсоров партии."
 POLITICS_KANJI_ISHIWARA_DESC: "Ищивара родился в городе Цуруока префектуры Ямагата в семье самураев. Ишивара решил стать военным и закончил Академию Императорской армии Японии в 1909 году. Он окончил Армейский штабной колледж вторым по успеваемости в 1918 году. Ишивара провёл несколько лет на различных штабных должностях, а затем был направлен на учёбу в Германию в качестве военного атташе. С 1922 по 1925 год он провёл в Берлине и Мюнхене изучая военную историю и стратегию. Перед отъездом в Германию Ишивара принял буддизм Ничирэн, а в течение 20-х он разработал теорию “последней войны”, после которой мир станет единым, мирным и буддийским, но кроме того сопровождается собственными техническими исследованиями Ишивары по военной истории, которые предсказывали неизбежную мировую войну. В 1928 году он был направлен в штаб Квантунской армии, где встретился с полковником Сейширо Итагаки и обрёл с ним крепкую дружбу. Вместе они подготовили тщательнейший план захвата Маньчжурии. Когда Маньчжурия оказалась под властью Чжана Сюэляна, то он стал проводить антияпонскую политику, чем вызвал недовольство местных японцев, и так как правительство в Токио было в политическом кризисе, то они обратились к военным Квантунской армии. Тогда Ишивара и Итагаки решили действовать и организовали самовольный захват Маньчжурии. Это привело Ишивару к общенациональной славе и особенной популярности у молодых и средних офицеров, в результате чего вокруг него сформировалась собственная армейская фракция. Это же вызвало ненависть его начальников, поэтому он был отправлен обратно в Японию командовать полком под начальство принца Нарухико. Однако, через некоторое время его снова перевели в генеральный штаб, так как способности Ишивара нельзя было недооценить."

Его воспитывали бабушка и дедушка, пока в 1875 году его не усыновил дядя, чьё поместье он и унаследовал. Он переехал в Токио и учился в подготовительных школах Токийского императорского университета, где одним из его одноклассников был будущий глава Тайного совета Ичики Китокуро. Хотя он сдал экзамены, в Токио у него часто возникали проблемы со здоровьем, и он был вынужден вернуться домой. Летом 1884 года он вернулся и поступил на юридический факультет Токийского императорского университета. Однако из-за частых пропусков занятий и неспособности завершить предварительное обучение Мачида так и не получил ученую степень. Далее он работал в нескольких региональных газетах, где познакомился с либеральными политиками Цуёси Инукаем и Юкио Одзаки. В мае 1893 года Мачида отправился в США, а оттуда в Англию, где в течение года изучал финансы и экономику. Вернувшись в Японию, он помог основать экономическую газету «Toyo Keizai Shimbun». После этого он стал работать в финансовой сфере как в частном секторе, так и на госдолжностях. 15 мая 1912 года Мачида был избран депутатом от округа Акита в нижнюю палату парламента Японии. Первоначально он работал в партии «Риккэн Кокуминто», затем перешел в «Риккэн Досикай», «Кенсэйкай» и «Риккэн Минсэйто». С 1919 по 1926 год Мачида также был президентом газеты Hochi Shimbun. В июне 1926 года он присоединился к кабинету Вакацуки в качестве министра сельского и лесного хозяйства. На посту министра сельского хозяйства он занимался вопросами консолидации сельского долга и развития сельских районов, предотвращая при этом резкие колебания цен на рис, заслужив похвалу как правящей, так и оппозиционной партий. В кабинете Окады он был назначен министром торговли и промышленности, а также министром финансов. Он решительно поддерживал малый и средний бизнес. Мачида был выдвинут в качестве возможного преемника Вакацуки Рэйдзиро на посту президента партии, и в итоге принял эту должность в 1935 году."

In many ways, this was facilitated by the general decline of statehood and the collapse of the monarchy in China. However, with the collapse of the Qing monarchy, a window of opportunity opened – some politicians proposed not to establish a republic, but to establish a new dynasty, but with a representative of the Han ethnic group, which was Zhu Yuxun, since he is a candidate for the throne of the Ming Dynasty – the last Han dynasty of China. However, the revolution gained momentum too quickly and abolished any monarchy in the country. Meanwhile, Zhu already had a family with two sons, and the salary was so small that he could not buy decent clothes to meet the former Emperor Pu Yi and his teacher in 1924. However, with the coming of Kuomintang power, he managed to get himself a new post – to become the keeper of the tomb of the Ming Dynasty, but he became mired in corruption cases, which caused a bigger scandal, as a result of which he had to flee in the early 30s to the territory of the northeast, where meanwhile his old friend, the emperor Pu Yi restored his throne with the help of the Japanese. However, upon arriving there, he could not get any new position, as the Japanese were not interested in him, and only Pu Yi helped Zhu and his family a little."

Meanwhile, Oscar Carmona, who came to power, gave Salazar the post of Minister of Finance with extremely broad powers, which allowed him to get out of the protracted economic crisis after the collapse of the first republic.\nThanks to these successes, in 1932 Salazar became Prime Minister, with the full support of the army, which was controlled by the incumbent president. By introducing a new constitution in 1933, he received practical unrestricted rights, which led many to call the new regime a dictatorship. At the same time, he introduced the doctrine of the "Estado Novo", based on corporatism, which should finally stabilise Portugal once its implementation at all levels was complete."

After failing in Masonic circles, Carmona left them to focus on his military career, during which he was an instructor at the Central Officer's School, director of the Cavalry School and commander of the IV Division. At the same time, he gained enough experience to become Minister of War in Machado's government in 1923. However, the constant uprisings and instability of the First Republic forced him to join the military movement on 28 May, making him one of the members of the Triumvirate. After holding many ministerial posts, he was eventually appointed interim president of the Republic in 1926, becoming permanent two years later. He was the one who helped Salazar to launch his "Estado Novo" programme, but after the death of the prime minister, the need for a course correction became apparent, and the only thing left was to find the right man."

During his studies, he became close to Salazar, the future Prime Minister, and promoted the idea of restoring the rights and privileges of the Church that it had enjoyed before the First Republic. This friendship made him patriarch of the Portuguese Church almost immediately after the establishment of the new regime. Despite his commitment to Salazar and the New State, he opposed the signing of the Concordat with the Holy See. Having gained a strong enough influence of the Church on the life of the country, he was able to reject the signing of the Concordat and restore religion to the political arena.

Communicating with Morras, Léon Daudet and Maurice Barrès, he quickly learnt the best of their ideas, becoming imbued with the idea of national-syndicalism, which could combine monarchism, nationalism, traditionalism and syndicalism.\nHaving gained some influence with the coup of 28 May, Preto eventually became the leader of the fascist movement in Portugal, but his ambitions led to his arrest in 1934 and his exile to Spain.

Then he entered the Masonic circles, receiving from there a significant influence on the politics of the country. His growing influence led to his appointment as governor-general of Angola, followed by his appointment as Minister of Colonies. In parallel, he took the post of Grand Master in his Masonic order, but was forced to leave this post after the formation of the "Estado Novo", because the secret organisations were banned by Salazar.
