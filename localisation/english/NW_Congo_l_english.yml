     congo.1.t: "Unsuccessful Wedding"
     congo.1.d: "One of the leaders wanted to marry a young girl who refused his proposal. He summoned the girl's mother in an attempt to pressure the parents into agreeing to the union. However, the girl's mother refused to let her daughter marry the leader. Not accepting the refusal, he struck the girl's mother twelve times, causing her to lose consciousness. Spitting on the unconscious woman's body, he called her a witch and ordered her to be removed from his house. Those who witnessed this incident unanimously claimed that the victim was a witch. Even the missionary who arrived at the scene for investigation sided with the leader.\n\nThe alternative version of this high-profile story, which gained no less popularity, suggests that it was the leader himself who used witchcraft as a means of controlling the failed bride and, consequently, exerting control over young women. African men, especially the elderly, were concerned about controlling their women, as they bore them children and worked around the house.\n\nPerhaps we should choose one of these versions and gain some advantages from it?"

     congo.1.b: "Support the people's story"
     
     congo.2.t: "Defectors from the Salvation Army"
     congo.2.d: "The Salvation Army is an international charitable organization associated with the Protestant faith, whose founders sought to bring salvation to the unfortunate. Their missionaries began appearing in Congo two years ago, helping ordinary people. Today, we've noticed their activity with the remnants of the Kimbanguist Church, whose teachings were based on the words of the Congolese false prophet Simon Kimbangu. These groups were actively discussing something among themselves, and it seemed that the members of the Salvation Army were very friendly toward the sectarians.\n\nWe should improve our surveillance of them; we cannot allow the Salvation Army to start supporting these sectarians!"
     congo.2.a: "The old problem just won't disappear..."
     
     congo.3.t: "Tribal Territory Disputes"
     congo.3.d: "Leaders on the right bank have entered into a dispute. The [GetEventCongo3_1] and [GetEventCongo3_2] tribal groups have started disputes among themselves and even had a few clashes resulting in casualties. Their disputes in the region threaten to escalate into a major confrontation. Perhaps, even though the disputants are unlikely to be satisfied with our decision, we should intervene, establish new borders, and prevent bloodshed?"

     congo.4.t: "Vaccination Against Sleeping Sickness"
     congo.4.d: "The prevalence of sleeping sickness in the [GetEventCongo4] region placed great responsibility on chiefs, who had to keep a close watch on their people to prevent it from spreading throughout the country. Our expert argues that new religious movements often accompany epidemics, and the creation of the Kibangile (witch hunts) demonstrates this relationship, albeit on a small scale.\n\nAfter each outbreak began, colonial authorities had to tighten control over the movements of Africans, as the colonial chiefs' boundaries in [GetEventCongo4] consolidated in one place and the African population became more settled and could not easily avoid disease-infested villages. Increased control over mobility also increased pressure on chiefs to act in ways that prevented the perceived or apparent danger of a possible epidemic.\n\nThe new rules required that Congolese wishing to travel to another region had to obtain written permission from their chief and territorial administrator if they wanted to leave the territory. In order to prevent an epidemic, the state began an active vaccination campaign, which the [GetEventCongo4] chiefs saw as a danger to their power, since they had no control over the process, so they began to sabotage the colonial government's measures in every possible way."

He returned to [GetEventCongo5] after working as a captain for the Great Lakes Railway Company until the company owners refused to renew his contract. To advance his claims to leadership, he sought to make Bena Hongi, a part of [GetEventCongo5], independent. He also made clear efforts to learn the language of the colonial authorities to assert his authority before the Belgians."

     congo.6.t: "Shinolobwe Mine Collapse"
     congo.6.d: "In Katanga, a mine owned by the Union Minière du Haut Katanga collapsed. Shinolobwe, located near the city of Jadotville, nearly ninety miles northwest of Elizabethville, was used for the production of radium, a byproduct of uranium. The mine, once a massive open pit with terraced sides descending about 225 feet, became unusable and was flooded due to a collapse that buried several dozen workers underneath. However, there were still significant reserves of extracted uranium ore."
     congo.6.a: "This is a massive blow to our finances"

     congo.7.t: "Conduct Kibangile"
     congo.7.d: "Not all chiefs loyal to us are popular with their subjects, especially under conditions of forced labor not favored by ordinary Congolese. To demonstrate their seriousness and authority, these chiefs have launched a witch-hunt known as Kibangile with violent enthusiasm. The witch-hunting itself was even enjoyed by those of their subjects who had no wrongdoing, but the rest were doomed to be accused by the chiefs of various sins on behalf of the church. Of course, these rumors quickly reached the missionaries, who immediately lobbied the colonial authorities to deny them.\nMany of the confessions of the accused were obtained after the suspected witches were hung upside down using vines or ropes that tied their limbs to two wooden poles about two and a half meters apart. The mechanism was called Kibangile. Failure to confess to involvement in witchcraft after being subjected to this torture mechanism resulted in the alleged witches having to drink a local mixture known as mwawi. Mwawi is a liquid made from boiling the bark of a tree known locally as kikumi, and is potentially life-threatening. If a person drinking mwawi survived, they were rehabilitated; if they died, they were recognized as witches."
     congo.7.a: "This will strengthen the position of chiefs loyal to us."
     congo.7.b: "The support of the church is more important."
     
     congo.8.t: "Mama Ukanga"
     congo.8.d: "Belgian authorities discovered a semi-secret society that called itself \"Mama Ukanga\", meaning \"mother of all charms\", in and around Boki. It is likely that these \"charms\" served different purposes depending on the specific local environment in which \"Mama Ukanga\" operated. Colonial authorities received conflicting interpretations of the Mama Ukanga society. First, Belgian agents believed that some workers hired by the Katanga Labor Exchange joined the society because they believed it fought witchcraft.\n\nMany colonial officials concluded that the mystical element of Mama Ukanga was only a cover, and in fact, the society had become a means of defense against the labor demands of the colonial state. Belgians working in Katanga claimed that it originated from Congolese working for Europeans in Elizabethville and had infiltrated Kongolo a year ago. According to them, the sexta spread throughout Katanga through the extensive railroad network.\n\nOn our orders, this society came under constant surveillance and study. After the study was completed, it was determined that this group was extremely xenophobic and undermined the colonial establishment. Consequently, leading members of the Mamas Ukanga Society in Kongolo were arrested and imprisoned to prevent it from spreading throughout the territory. These adherents lived in the southern part of Kongolo, and used Mama Ukanga to avoid compulsory labor by recruiting their followers of lesser rank to do the work.\n\nThe new arrests only exacerbated the situation in the region.\n\nAlthough the adherents of the local society were closely monitored by the state, Mama Ukanga was not easy to eradicate because it suggested that tired farmers avoid cash crop production and replace it with subsistence farming, which is not beneficial to us because it would reduce cotton production."
     congo.8.a: "Immediately capture all those associated with this society!"
     congo.8.b: "We will continue our careful surveillance."
     
     congo.9.t: "A new god in the Congo".
     congo.9.d: "During one of the chiefs' gatherings, one chief declared himself the 'invulnerable god' of Ben Mambwe. By claiming to be 'God', he was responding to the omnipresence of sin, which the locals often 'exterminated' through witch hunts. By declaring himself 'God,' the chief began to oppose the growing power of missionaries over his lands and the souls of tribal members."
     congo.9.a: "Finish the heretic."
     congo.9.b: "Such gods among the tribes can no longer be counted..."
     
     congo.10.t: "Black Mission."
     congo.10.d: "The actions of Salvation Army defectors have taken dangerous shape. Simon Mpadi, a former sergeant of the Salvation Army Baptist Missionary Society, created a "Black Mission" within the ranks of the Kimbangists. We've never been able to find out if the Salvation Army itself was involved, but even so, the scope of these sectarians has begun to take on alarming proportions."
     congo.10.a: "Identify all those involved!"
     congo.10.b: "We will accept them as brothers!"
     
     congo.11.t: "Black Mission"
     congo.11.d: "About 150 villages in our country have sent a letter to General-Governor Pierre Rickmans requesting official permission to establish a separate African church. This fact itself is disturbing, considering our support for official missionary missions. However, perhaps recognizing the Kimbanguist church can pacify the people?"
     congo.11.a: "Arrest all those involved and disband the 'Black Mission'!"
     congo.11.b: "We will recognize the new church on Congo's territory!"
     
     congo.12.t: "Luluabourg Mutiny"
     congo.12.d: "Force Publique is our main military force that must be in constant readiness. To maintain them at a high level, in the Congo's climate, they must undergo periodic vaccination, which did not find support among the Congolese. Dark-skinned non-commissioned officers led by Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi staged a mutiny in Luluabourg. The trigger for the mutiny was the vaccination plan for soldiers serving on the front lines, although the soldiers were also dissatisfied with the demands placed on them and the treatment they received from their white officers. On the morning of February 20, the mutineers stormed the armory of the base and looted the white quarter of the city. City residents fled, and some white civilians were killed. The mutineers declared their desire for independence, then dispersed to their native villages, looting along the way, but they failed to spread the uprising to neighboring garrisons."
     congo.12.a: "Immediately arrest the instigators!"
     congo.12.b: "No one is following them anyway."
     
     congo.13.t: "Masisi-Lubutu Uprising"
     congo.13.d: "Due to the policies of the central authorities, a major uprising of local ethnic tribes began in Kivu, in the eastern part of Belgian Congo, who were dissatisfied with the taxation and collective labor policies that have developed in recent years."
     congo.13.a: "We will be able to resolve this peacefully."
     congo.13.b: "We will embrace them as brothers!"
     
     congo.14.t: "Agricultural Observers' Objectives"
     congo.14.d: "The state, utilizing its monopoly on legitimate violence against unruly workers, hired agricultural observers whose task was to ensure that farmers maintained their fields in order. Private companies followed their example and hired their own cotton observers, whose work generally coincided with the work of agricultural observers. This policy guaranteed that there would be as few gaps as possible in monitoring agricultural operations and in preventing work avoidance. As a result, those farmers who did not meet their cotton quotas were quickly identified and subjected to punishment or even arrest.\n\nNaturally, such an approach did not endear leaders to the people who, being loyal to the colonial administration, made their people work diligently, growing and harvesting cotton."
     congo.14.a: "Why are they dissatisfied? Workers should work."

     congo.15.t: "Harvest and Cotton Collection"
     congo.15.d: "Apart from the exhausting work required for cotton production, during which the sick increasingly relied on 'help from their loved ones', it also interfered with food cultivation. The pressure on people working in the cotton fields was immense, primarily because of the punishments that could be imposed on those who failed to meet their quotas. This pressure weakened the efforts of farmers to grow food for their own consumption.\n\nThe amount of time spent attempting to balance subsistence farming with cotton production resulted in far fewer people willing to help those who could not fulfill their duties as required by the colonial state. Even after the cotton was harvested, many workers had to cover long distances to transport the cotton harvest to the colonial markets.\n\nLeaders became the only ones who could requisition the necessary labor for tending their fields, regardless of personal obligations to others. They could also mobilize additional labor from those tribes who did not participate in colonial politics or simply slackened off, evading the overseers. As a result, leaders became objects of public resentment and mockery as social differentiation accelerated under the cotton regime. Before cotton, it was somewhat different; those forced to work on a leader's land could easily harvest or produce some goods for the common good. Under the cotton regime, all the produce grown on the leaders' land continued to enrich them."
     congo.15.a: "Perhaps a reasonable solution would be to make leaders share with the workers."
     congo.15.b: "During the harvest, we will allocate additional labor for cotton picking."
     congo.15.c: "Let the leaders themselves decide this matter."
     
     congo.16.t: "The Situation with Roads"
     congo.16.d: "Extensive work on roads, so necessary for any State, has led to high mortality among road workers due to climate and hard work, as well as to the relocation of villages and the loss of land rights and rights of use. Nevertheless, the construction of roads gave us access to rural residents previously inaccessible to our authorities, from whom we can now collect taxes, recruit cheap labor and control the situation with tribal loyalty. The issue of roads has become particularly acute in cotton–growing areas, because cotton is the main product of our export to the metropolis.However, we must take into account that such an approach has its risks. The construction of a road in Lubefu, in the Sankuru district, showed the risks road workers face. Of the 6381 employees hired, 210 people died in three months due to difficult working conditions, malnutrition and diseases. These difficult situations contributed to the spread of rumors that were not profitable for us that «the work of white people devours people»."
     congo.16.a: "The main thing is the result!"
    
     congo.17.t: "The Life of a Congolese Miner"
     congo.17.d: "With the creation of the Union Miniere work camps, many workers were grateful to the \"employers\", while others were less enthusiastic.It was obvious to Congolese who had at least some education that companies like Union Miniere were profiting well from the sweat of their workers. But how far does it go? One of the workers told a tourist who arrived in the Congo: "You have to remember that the salary of a Congolese remains low. In fact, they are even laughable to you white people. One or two francs a day is a pittance. One day I went back to work to see a few friends during my rest hours. I found them with the boss, a white man. While they were chatting, one of the workers asked him about his salary. Here's how white answered: "Does black need money? But what can he do about it? We give you food rations and you eat as much as you can. When you get sick, there are pharmacies and hospitals until you recover. Why do you always demand a salary increase?" That was the white man's answer. In the whites' view, the black man did not need to be paid."
     congo.17.a: "It is necessary to stop these rumors..."
     congo.17.b: "The state will take care of ordinary people!"
     
     congo.18.t: "Deterioration of Working Conditions"
     congo.18.d: "The increase in the number of orders due to the war has led to an increase in labor productivity with severe consequences. The number of fatal accidents at Union Miniere factories has doubled. More and more workers started running at night.\n\nThe new interview of Dibwe dia Mwembu with the miners of Elizabethville, which has been published, gives a vivid idea of the conditions in the mines. According to one employee, Jean Feliz Cabeya: "The working conditions are very bad. We are exposed to an increasing number of accidents or outbreaks of diseases. The whites forced us to work like machines, like slaves. One day, there was a disgusting incident. When we were working hard, one of us was so tired that he could not continue and fell on the stone floors of the mine. A moment later, the foreman entered, who attacked our colleague, trying to lift the unfortunate man with kicks. We were shocked by such treatment. The head of our team took a chance and moved on the white foreman with the words: "When will you stop hitting a person who is too weak to respond?". The whole brigade was fined for this."
     congo.18.a: "Shut up all the dissatisfied!"
     congo.18.b: "Punish the foreman who exceeded his authority!"
     
     congo.19.t: "The beginning of Strikes"
     congo.19.d: "Strikes have begun among the miners of the copper industry in Northern Rhodesia. White foremen from the Association of Agents of the Union of Miners and Branches went on strike, who were dissatisfied with both the changed volume of work and the payment, which did not correspond to the new conditions at all."
     congo.19.a: "Nothing critical, an ordinary day in the colony."
     
     congo.20.t: "Expansion of the Strike"
     congo.20.d: "Simultaneously with the strikes of white trade unions, the mines began to grow a cadre of skilled black workers who felt more confident every day, and they even began to have a question: «Why don't they imitate whites?». With the realization of this thought, the miners of Jadoville, Kipushi, Likasi, Luishi and the foundries of Elizabethville, began a general strike.There have been reports of urban factory workers leaving cities to live in rural areas. Messages circulating among mining executives have begun to warn of an \"unhealthy atmosphere\" engulfing African workers. Attempts were made to strike in Kikola and Kipushi. The workers of the factories of Shituru and Pandotville also started strikes. The striking workers were sent to nearby areas, to Likasi, Luisia and Kambova, to ask for support. This regional general strike was based on an alliance between factory workers in Elizabethville and Jadoville and the underground workers of Kipusha.\n\n Women played a prominent role as workers, mothers and wives. For many factory workers, the main requirement was to raise wages to 1.50 francs per hour. The demands of male factory workers were changed to reflect the issues raised by women who demanded that rations be given to them and their husbands. They also wanted to restore living conditions from the 1920s, when wives were given benefits, including free sewing machines."
     congo.20.a: "Send troops to Jadoville!"
     
     congo.21.t: "Troops in Jadovil"
     congo.21.d: "The troops sent to bombard the demonstrations in Jadovil killed fifteen people, but this not only did not calm the workers, but on the contrary, only intensified the growing strikes across the country. On this day, all workers at all major Union Miniere enterprises were absent from their jobs, not to mention factory workers, railway workers, night cleaners, watchmen and food carriers who also participated in strikes.\n\nPat's strike has also reached Elizabethville. By taking our government by surprise, and some of its members into a complete panic. To calm the strikers, the governor of Katanga - Maron addressed them, promising to raise the average wage by 50 percent. Perhaps we should immediately satisfy their demands, temporarily lull their vigilance, or respond with violence."
     congo.21.a: "We will make concessions"
     congo.21.b: "We will divide the strikers, and then we will open fire!"
     congo.21.c: "We will force them to disperse by deception"
     
     congo.22.t: "Successful Negotiations with the Workers."
     congo.22.d: "The workers who arrived in Elizabethville were united under the leadership of Leonard Mpoya, a native of Bena Nshimba. He was a high school graduate, and by the standards of the Africans was considered an intelligent and educated man who had also worked as a clerk in a Congo factory. He convinced the Congolese that they risked dying in vain in the mines, for a pittance, that the Union Miniere should increase the wages of the blacks subjected to such terrible conditions. «Why should the white man be paid more than the black man, when all the white man does is stand on the sidelines giving orders and putting his hands behind his back with a pipe in his mouth? They must fulfill our demands, or tomorrow, not one of us will go to work!»\n\nThe workers' demands were heard and they were given increased rations. In front of them, the director of Union Miniere drew up and announced a new order to increase the wages of the workers, effective from today. The satisfied workers returned to their workplaces, and following them, the other members of the strike also began to disperse."
     congo.22.a: "We had to go for it."
     
     congo.23.t: "The Tragedy in Elizabethville"
     congo.23.d: "The workers who arrived in Elizabethville were united under the leadership of Leonard Mpoya, a native of Bena Nshimba. He graduated from high school, and by the standards of Africans was considered an intelligent and educated man, who also worked as a clerk at one of the factories of the Congo. He convinced the Congolese that they risked dying needlessly in the mines, for a few pennies, that the Union Miniere should increase the wages of blacks subjected to such terrible conditions. «Why should a white man be paid more than a black man when all a white man does is stand aside, giving orders and putting his hands behind his back with a pipe in his mouth? They must fulfill our requirements, otherwise tomorrow, none of us will go to work!».\n\nAfter the workers' demands were listened to, they were told that the rations would be increased. There was a long discussion between white and black workers. The director of the Union Miniere tried to convince them, but in vain, so he asked the workers to gather on the football field again to find a compromise. A few hours later, the workers gathered again in front of the top of the local authorities, who advised the workers to return home and choose four representatives who could discuss the current state of affairs with the Belgians.\n\nUnfortunately, the workers refused the proposed negotiations, which they did not want to conduct, arguing that they just want a salary increase. During the negotiations that followed, Leonard Mpoyi found himself face to face with the governor, who again demanded that the workers return home. Mpoyi replied: «I refuse. You must provide us with proof that the company has agreed to raise our salary.» To which Maron replied: «Now you can personally check it out!». Then he pulled a gun out of his pocket and shot Leonard. After the brutal murder, Maron calmly ordered the troops to shoot at the strikers.\n\nThe next day, after the massacre by the soldiers, most of the strikers returned to work, and the campaigns and the colonial authorities were forced to make some concessions."
     congo.23.a: "Serves the rebels right!"
    
     congo.24.t: "Workers Disperse"
     congo.24.d: "The workers who arrived in Elizabethville were united under the leadership of Leonard Mpoya, a native of Bena Nshimba.

The director of Union Miniere managed to assure everyone that the increases they required would be received in full, along with the new salary.

     congo.25.d: "On payday, workers discovered the deception of the colonial authorities, and the campaigns under their control. The new rations had been allocated the same amount as the workers' wages themselves.\nThis caused a new wave of resentment, which this time affected not only the Elizabethville district, but also the rest of the country, which was underpaid the wage supplement due. In some workplaces there were violent incidents, and in other places workers left their workplaces to begin organizing new strikes and strikes against the current government. On the first day, uniting workers regardless of skin color, they took on a larger scale than at the peak of past strikes.\nThe unforgettable Leonard Mpoyi was once again at the head of the uprising."
