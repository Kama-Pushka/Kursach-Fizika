 # POLITICS_YIN_JU_KENG_DESC: "Инь Жугэн родом из уезда Пинъян провинции Чжэцзян. В 1902 году богатый отец отправил его в Японию, где Инь Жугэн стал изучать японский язык и в 1905 году поступил в 1-ю высшую школу Токио (подготовительная школа Токийского императорского университета). На следующий год он поступил в 7-ю школу военной подготовки. Во время учёбы в Японии Инь Жугэн стал активным членом организации Тунмэнхой, а также женился на японке. По распоряжению лидера Тунмэнхоя — Хуан Сина — Инь Жугэн вернулся в Китай для руководства революционной деятельностью в провинции Хубэй. После образования Китайской Республики Инь Жугэн вступил в Гоминьдан. После участия во 2-й конференции Гоминьдана в 1913 году он решил вернуться в Японию, чтобы продолжить образование в университете Васэда. Позже он участвовал в деятельности множества китайских правительств. Благодаря своему большому опыту жизни в Японии и связям с многими политическими деятелями этой страны, его постоянно назначили на должности, связанные с установлением контакта с ней. Когда в 1933 году в соответствии с Перемирием Тангу в провинции Хэбэй была образована демилитаризованная зона, Инь Жугэн стал её комиссаром. Под влиянием генерала Кэндзи Доихара 15 ноября 1935 года он объявил свою администрацию Антикоммунистическим автономным правительством Восточного Хэбэя, не подчиняющимся правительству в Нанкине. Однако, становится полностью марионеткой в руках японских военных ему не хочется, и он поддерживает контакты со своими старыми китайскими друзьями, чтобы иметь запасной план действий." пропал

     big_contrabanda: "Rampant Smuggling"
     big_contrabanda_desc: "Another economic problem facing our Government is the proliferation of smuggling and black markets on the coast of East Hebei, through which the Japanese import vast quantities of their own goods into our territory duty free. This deprives our budget of tax revenue and also ruins Chinese traders and manufacturers. It is very difficult for us to curb this process because it is effectively covered by the Japanese army."

 #Events
     hebei.1.t: "Opening of Radio Station in Tangshan"
     hebei.1.d: "East Hebei's first media outlet was established on February 16, 1933, when the former local government launched the Jidong Daily, a newspaper that continues publication to this day. Now, however, media development in the region took a new step forward. With advances in technology and the rise of numerous private radio stations, it became essential for the government to establish its own broadcasting channel to deliver official news and promote accurate political values to the public. To achieve this, the government purchased the private radio station Jiansheng, located in the coastal city of Tangshan in Hebei."
     hebei.1.a: "We are mastering modern technology"
     hebei.2.t: "Manchukuo's Loan for Military Development"
     hebei.2.d: "The Manchukuo government has granted us a 5 million yuan loan to develop our own army. We now need to determine precisely how to invest these funds."
     hebei.2.a: "We'll use it to buy artillery"
     hebei.2.b: "Let's stock up on extra small arms"
     hebei.2.c: "We'll invest equally in artillery and small arms"
     hebei.3.t: "Huaxin Textile Co. Owners Made Concessions"
     hebei.3.d: "At the end of 1935, our government pressured the owners of Huaxin Textile Co. to sell a substantial block of shares to Japanese investors at a reduced price. The company’s management initially refused the offer, but Japanese representatives persisted in their demands. Exercising "soft power", we imposed high taxes on the company's goods, leading Huaxin Textile Co.’s management to recognize that agreeing to our terms was preferable to later pleading against the potential nationalization of their facilities."
     hebei.3.a: "They're a pleasure to do business with"
     hebei.4.t: "Autonomy of Five Northern Provinces"
     hebei.4.d: "Following the establishment of Manchukuo and the hostilities from 1931 to 1934 that placed northeast China east of the Great Wall under Kwantung Army control, the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China signed the Tanggu Truce, establishing a demilitarized zone south of the Great Wall. Under the terms of this truce and the subsequent 1935 He-Umezu Agreement, this zone was also cleared of Kuomintang and Chinese government political and military influence. However, Japanese military ambitions extended further, with the goal of economically dominating North China and ensuring a secure rear for the Kwantung Army in the event of conflict with the USSR. To this end, they devised a 'Plan for the Autonomy of the Five Northern Provinces,' whereby Japanese spies and military leaders began pressuring the governors of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces to declare independence from the Nanjing government. The first to cooperate with the Japanese was Yin Ju-keng, governor of 22 counties in eastern Hebei within the demilitarized zone.\n\nOn November 15, 1935, Yin Ju-keng declared the territories under his control autonomous. Ten days later, on November 25, he proclaimed their independence from the Republic of China, establishing Tongzhou as the capital. The new government quickly signed economic and military treaties with Japan. The Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps, formed under the Tanggu Truce, was disbanded and restructured into the East Hebei Army with Japanese military support. Simultaneously, in the remaining areas of Hebei Province, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established under the leadership of renowned General Song Zheyuan, with control maintained by remnants of Feng Yuxiang's Gominjun. This region effectively became a neutral zone between the forces of the Nanjing National Revolutionary Army and the Kwantung Army. Yin Ju-keng still maintains connections with Song, suggesting potential for coordinated political action in the future."
     hebei.4.a: "Is it possible to fool both Japan and Nanjing?" 
     hebei.5.t: "Discontent in Rural Areas"
     hebei.5.d: "Our domestic economic policies are not resonating with the public. Dissatisfaction is mounting in urban areas, where small shopkeepers and large traders alike are facing bankruptcy. However, the most severe challenges are in rural areas. Land redistribution favoring Japanese owners is fueling deep resentment among peasants, whose working conditions worsen daily, as well as among former Chinese landowners, who are losing their land under threats of personal violence."
     hebei.5.a: "The Japanese are crossing all possible boundaries"
     hebei.6.t: "Uprising of Yellow Sand Society"
     hebei.6.d: "The Yellow Sand Society is challenging to characterize precisely: some describe it as a rural secret society, while others refer to it as a popular religious sect. The primary issue is that its origins are unclear due to frequent name changes and its appeal among the lower strata of society. One thing is certain: it is active in Northern China, and its ideology is centered on millenarianism and monarchism. Furthermore, the society expresses loyalty to the Han dynasty Ming, which is idealized in their beliefs. They assert that the restoration of the Ming would result in a 'kingdom of happiness and justice for all' under the rule of a 'good sovereign.'\n\nIn any case, growing discontent among rural peasants has further boosted the popularity of this movement, prompting its leaders to attempt an uprising. However, the movement remains relatively weak for now, and our army should be able to manage the situation effectively."
     hebei.6.a: "This will be a good test for our soldiers"
     hebei.7.t: "Uprising of Yellow Sand Society"
     hebei.7.d: "The Yellow Sand Society is challenging to characterize precisely: some describe it as a rural secret society, while others refer to it as a popular religious sect. The primary issue is that its origins are unclear due to frequent name changes and its appeal among the lower strata of society. One thing is certain: it is active in Northern China, and its ideology is centered on millenarianism and monarchism. Furthermore, the society expresses loyalty to the Han dynasty Ming, which is idealized in their beliefs. They assert that the restoration of the Ming would result in a 'kingdom of happiness and justice for all' under the rule of a 'good sovereign.'\n\nIn any case, growing discontent among rural peasants has further boosted the popularity of this movement, prompting its leaders to attempt an uprising. Our task at the moment is to neutralise the rebels before too many peasants join them."
     hebei.7.a: "We can handle it" 
     hebei.8.t: "Uprising of Yellow Sand Society"
     hebei.8.d: "The Yellow Sand Society is challenging to characterize precisely: some describe it as a rural secret society, while others refer to it as a popular religious sect. The primary issue is that its origins are unclear due to frequent name changes and its appeal among the lower strata of society. One thing is certain: it is active in Northern China, and its ideology is centered on millenarianism and monarchism. Furthermore, the society expresses loyalty to the Han dynasty Ming, which is idealized in their beliefs. They assert that the restoration of the Ming would result in a 'kingdom of happiness and justice for all' under the rule of a 'good sovereign.'\n\nIn any case, growing discontent among rural peasants has further boosted the popularity of this movement, prompting its leaders to attempt an uprising. Because of the scale of the movement and the power of the uprising, we will have to use all the army available to us."
     hebei.8.a: "Let's crush these madmen as soon as possible"
     hebei.8.b: "Stand up to Qing! Restore Ming!" 
     hebei.9.t: "Fighting Rebels"
     hebei.9.d: "There have been several hard fights with the rebels, but almost all of them have ended in our favour. The armed peasants are being pushed back from the towns, but some of them are trying to fight underground in the villages, which often causes our army to destroy them."
     hebei.9.a: "The initiative is on our side"
     hebei.10.t: "Reduction of Pockets of Rebellion"
     hebei.10.d: "Our troops have all but broken the resistance of the Yellow Sand Society soldiers. Thanks to the agitation of the peasants, defections to the rebellion have been reduced, and all we have to do now is wipe out the remnants of the rebellion. It has concentrated in several cotton districts, temporarily disrupting the textile mills."
     hebei.10.a: "They don't stand a chance"
     hebei.11.t: "Rebellion Crushed"
     hebei.11.d: "We have finally crushed the Yellow Sand Society rebellion. Additionally, our agitators have been actively campaigning against them in rural areas to prevent a resurgence in their popularity. Unfortunately, we were unable to capture their leader, who escaped with a few dozen loyal followers into territory controlled by Republican China."
     hebei.11.a: "We should modernise our troops with the help of our allies"
     hebei.12.t: "Out of Control"
     hebei.12.d: "We were unable to fully suppress the rebellion before it gained significant popularity among the peasant masses. Our unchecked arms smuggling has allowed the Yellow Sands to acquire numerous weapons for their supporters through the black market, and they now pose a genuine threat to our control in East Hebei."
     hebei.12.a: "Let's crush these madmen as soon as possible"

     EHB_ANTI_REBEL_DECISION: "We sent our troops to quell the rebellion in the villages. Through a series of raids and minor casualties, we were able to drive the rebels out of the villages and shake their position. However, this was not the last battle and the rebels continue to fight in other settlements."
     EHB_LAST_DECISION: "We sent our troops to quell the rebellion in the villages. Through a series of raids and minor casualties, we were able to drive the rebels out of the villages and shake their position. It was the last pockets of resistance from the rebels. Now we are out of danger of a full-scale uprising and can focus on other matters."
     EHB_LAST_DECISION_ARTILLERY: "We bombarded the last rebel camps with artillery. The blow was unexpected. We inflicted considerable damage and undermined the morale of the rebels without suffering any casualties. As a result, some of the remaining rebels surrendered, and those who continued to resist were wiped out by ground forces. Now we are out of danger of a full-scale uprising and can focus on other matters."
     EHB_LAST_DECISION_ARTILLERY_OPTION: "Artillery is a powerful thing"
     EHB_ANTI_REBEL_DECISION_ARTILLERY: "We bombarded the last rebel camps with artillery. The blow was unexpected. We inflicted considerable damage and undermined the morale of the rebels without suffering any casualties. This has certainly weakened the rebellion. But nevertheless, this is not the last camp, and at other points resistance still exists and spreads."
     EHB_ANTI_REBEL_DECISION_ARTILLERY_OPTION: "Bomb them all!"
     EHB_LAST_DECISION_NEGOTIATOR: "Our negotiators have met with the leaders of the rebellion to try to find a compromise. After negotiations, the rebels agreed to all our conditions. One of the reasons was that their situation was extremely dire and they could no longer continue to fight as almost all their troops had been destroyed by the army. The rebel soldiers were ordered to lay down their arms, so we were able to end this unrest diplomatically. Now we are out of danger of a full-scale uprising and can focus on other matters."
     EHB_LAST_DECISION_NEGOTIATOR_OPTION: "The word is the best, and most effective weapon of all"
     EHB_ANTI_REBEL_DECISION_NEGOTIATOR: "Our negotiators have met with the leaders of the rebellion to try to find a compromise. After much negotiation, the rebels have agreed to some of our terms, but have still not agreed to stop fighting. Perhaps the long and hard negotiations will bear fruit after all."
