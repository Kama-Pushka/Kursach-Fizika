 ### EVENTS ###

 NW_NIC.0.t: "The Beginning Collapse of Democracy"
 NW_NIC.0.d: "For many years, until 1933, Nicaragua was actually a protectorate of the United States of America, and only General Sandino's war of liberation against the occupiers helped to ensure that the American military forces left the country. However, this does not cancel the fact that the country's top capitalists and oligarchs were still loyal to America, or were its investments at all.\n\nThis was one of the reasons why Antonio Somoza, head of the National Guard, appointed to the post at the insistence of the U.S. ambassador, ordered the assassination of General Sandino, who had been promised security, during the peace talks.\n\nPresident Sacasa publicly condemned Sandino's murder and demanded a full investigation and identification of those responsible. However, the perpetrator of Sandino's death, not only did not fear the investigation, but at one of the banquets he publicly stated: "The only way to end the crimes was to eliminate General Sandino and the Sandinistas. In the neighborhood of Segovia, bandits were destroying homes, looting, killing. The National Guard could not look on these crimes with indifference. I, the chief of the Guard, was able to eliminate those who were responsible for the acts of banditry. There came a moment when I was forced to solve the problem, and I did it, and I am not trying to avoid responsibility. \n\nThis statement was a slap in the face, the beginning of the crisis of power, as Somoza's statement was printed in all newspapers, and it became a public slap in the face of the current president, who was formally looking for those responsible for the murder of Sandino and his associates. Moreover, in a congressional session, both parties, conservative and liberal, voted in favor of amnesty for all those involved, which finally undermined the president's authority."
 NW_NIC.0.a: "We put power in the hands of the military by ourselves."
 
 NW_NIC.1.t: "The Start of the Election Race"
 NW_NIC.1.d: "The previous events unleashed the head of the National Guard, and from 1934 he promoted his protégés wherever he could, strengthening his position. On his side were also big business owners, dissatisfied with the economic policy of Sakasa, who was a doctor by training, and did not realize that the time of big capital had come. However, this was understood by Somoza, diligently courting businessmen and promising to soften the monetary policy in case of coming to power.\n\nAt the same time, since the end of 1934, the head of the National Guard began to promote his candidacy for election. Using the resources of the Guard, he organised local groups of "Samoists" from among the reputable people of the localities, promising lucrative positions in case of victory. He also appealed to the youth, organising groups of supporters among them, at the same time appealing to workers and peasants, promising Labour Code for the former and land for the latter. Also played a role and criticism of previous politicians, whose policies led to the plight of ordinary people.\n\nThe National Guard fully supported their head, actively campaigning for him even in churches, while interfering with the election campaign of potential opponents of Somoza. Obviously, Somoza's campaign has gained momentum to the point where we cannot sit idly by and we need to do something about it."
 NW_NIC.1.a: "There's nothing we can do about it."
 NW_NIC.1.b: "Let Mr President address the American people."
 
 NW_NIC.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks to Interfere"
 NW_NIC.2.d: "The incumbent president of Nicaragua, $NIC_Juan_Bautista_Sacasa$, has turned to us for support. The incumbent general of the National Guard, essentially the country's armed forces, has grown frighteningly popular and is threatening to take over the country.\n\nWhile our New Deal policy does not include direct intervention, we can provide financial support against the general's actions.\n\nBut before we do that, we should consider how we would benefit. Somoza is unlikely to take a course against us, and helping Sacasa would only drive Nicaragua further into debt, which they are already struggling to repay."
 NW_NIC.2.a: "Somoza may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch!"
 NW_NIC.2.b: "We will support democracy."
 
 NW_NIC.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Interfere"
 NW_NIC.3.d: "Adhering to the New Deal policy, the U.S. has refused any interference in our domestic political affairs, leaving us to solve our own problems."
 NW_NIC.3.a: "We can't rely on them anymore!"
 
 NW_NIC.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Are Ready to Support"
 NW_NIC.4.d: "Because of New Deal policies, America cannot directly interfere in the events taking place in the country, however, they are willing to give full financial support to the incumbent president so that he can bring his protégé to power."
 NW_NIC.4.a: "Somoza's influence needs to be limited."
 
 NW_NIC.5.t: "Cab Drivers' Strike"
 NW_NIC.5.d: "Under the leadership of General Somoza, a strike of cab drivers was organised in Managua, protesting against the shortage of gasoline and demanding the resignation of the head of the National District of the capital, Porfirio Perez. Realizing that they were in no danger, cab drivers began to threaten violent actions.\n\nThe worst thing in this situation is that the instigator of everything, in front of the Americans blamed everything on the current president, who allegedly did not want to send Perez to resign, and ordered the National Guard to open fire on the strikers. Somoza in his turn, as a true Democrat, naturally responded by refusing to do so."
 NW_NIC.5.a: "What an insolent slander!"
 
 NW_NIC.6.t: "The USA Demands Somoza Stop Rocking the Boat"
 NW_NIC.6.d: "The U.S. envoy went directly to the president for clarification, to which he received a full explanation of the situation and proof of Somoza's involvement. Somoza's ensuing summons knocked the arrogant general off his guard, after he demanded that the boat not be rocked in order to preserve order and protect American lives and property. Knowing from his own experience what could follow, Somoza was forced to address the crowd and announce that Perez had been replaced by a loyal man.\n\nObviously, Washington will note that Somoza is becoming a destabilizing factor for the country and must be dealt with."
 NW_NIC.6.a: "Obviously, in this confrontation, the USA is on our side."
 
 NW_NIC.7.t: "The Crazy Event"
 NW_NIC.7.d: "Unfortunately, the modification developers made a mistake and made two events with the same text. Now I (the translator) don't know what to translate."
 NW_NIC.7.a: "That's sad, isn't it?"
 
 NW_NIC.8.t: "Disagreement among Democrats"
 NW_NIC.8.d: "The Traditional Conservative Party said that they would refuse to nominate its candidate and would only support a liberal if the Liberal Party nominated Somoza.\n\nThis ultimatum put the Constitutionalist Liberal Party in a difficult position. The Liberals wanted to maintain their alliance with the Conservatives, but did not want Somoza as president. In order to pull the Conservatives to their side, President Sacasa's protege, Arguello, offered them 40% of congressional seats before the elections, which was considerably more than the 1932 agreement. In addition, the newly elected liberal president was willing to give the Conservatives a number of ministerial posts."
 NW_NIC.8.a: "Democracy is about making compromises."
 
 NW_NIC.9.t: "A New Cooperation Agreement"
 NW_NIC.9.d: "In the presence of Sacasa, the Liberals and the Conservatives signed a new Cooperation Agreement that called for a joint nomination of a presidential candidate by the leadership of both parties and subsequent constitutional reform. The single candidate was to be a Liberal, but would have the support of both Sacasa and Somoza. Parliamentary seats were allocated in advance. The Conservatives were guaranteed two ministerial posts and five political leadership seats in five departments. However, Somoza refused to authorise the Agreement. He told the envoys of the Liberal and Conservative parties that he would name his own presidential candidate because he, Somoza, was the most popular among the population.\n\nOn the contrary, Somoza rejected the agreement of the Liberals and Conservatives and proposed another option. In each electoral district in Parliament will run one candidate from the party that won in that district in 1932. The members of the Supreme Court he would select himself. All appointments to command positions in the Guard will be henceforth made by him, not the president.\n\nPreferably, Somoza insisted on replacing the commander of the Guard garrison in Leon, Ramiro Sakasa - nephew of the president. Finally, Somoza demanded that the president immediately allocate funds to purchase uniforms and shoes for the National Guard, which would help him consolidate his position over the Guard. In order to gain the support of the civil servants, Somoza demagogically demanded the abolition of the 5% payroll deduction that each civil servant used to fund the ruling party. Only if these conditions were met would Somoza agree to give up the presidency, since with complete control over the Guard, any president would be a puppet in his hands."
 NW_NIC.9.a: "We will not consider this ultimatum!"
 
 NW_NIC.10.t: "A Meeting of the Democratic Parties"
 NW_NIC.10.d: "Since no compromise could be reached with Somoza, the Liberals and the Conservatives gathered for a meeting without the general, where they nominated a single candidate from both parties - Leonardo Arguello. However, at the same time the alarming news came that Somoza was preparing a military coup. With only the presidential regiment and the garrison army in León on the side of the authorities, and the only armed forces on Somoza's side, the best solution would be to once again ask for American support."
 NW_NIC.10.a: "We will not allow the military in power!"
 
 NW_NIC.11.t: "Visit of the Envoy of Nicaragua"
 NW_NIC.11.d: "The current president of Nicaragua, Juan Bautista Sacasa, sent his brother Federico to us who asked us to rein in General Somoza. Since the National Guard was created by us, we are to some extent responsible for its actions.\n\nThe envoy also said that there was an impending coup, so the president asked us to send a warship to the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua for protection."
 NW_NIC.11.a: "It is up to Nicaraguans to maintain order in Nicaragua."
 NW_NIC.11.b: "We need to preserve our investment."
 
 NW_NIC.12.t: "The Beginning of the Coup"
 NW_NIC.12.d: "Somoza sent an echelon of National Guardsmen to Leon, where he demanded that the president's nephew surrender command. When he refused, the general began shelling the fort in Leon and the presidential palace in Managua. In response, the president asked diplomatic representatives in Managua to protest to Somoza about the inadmissibility of bloodshed.\n\nDiplomats from Britain, France, Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras expressed their readiness to protest, but all diplomats realized that Somoza could only obey the Americans, and therefore asked a diplomat to put his signature under the joint appeal."
 NW_NIC.12.a: "Let's hope this idea succeeds."
 
 NW_NIC.13.t: "Coup D'état Has Been Stopped"
 NW_NIC.13.d: "Today, a U.S. warship arrived at the fort in León, and with a couple of warning shots, suspended all National Guard activity.\n\nFollowing this, a document opposing bloodshed was delivered to Somoza. It contained not only the signatures of French, British and Central American diplomats, but also those of the United States of America itself.\n\nSeeing this direct warning, Somoza was forced to give the order to lay down his arms, awaiting further results."
 NW_NIC.13.a: "Arrest Somoza and the officers loyal to him!"
 
 NW_NIC.14.t: "The Coup is Gaining Momentum"
 NW_NIC.14.d: "The State Department told the U.S. diplomat that diplomatic mediation in the conflict could only take place with the consent of all parties, including Somoza, which automatically made the protest unviable.\n\n\On seeing the inaction on the part of the U.S., Somoza moved to more decisive action, and by this time his units had seized the power plant, a beer factory and all key points in the capital. Former President Moncada arrived in Managua in full general's uniform to support his protégé's coup.\n\nWhile the fighting was going on in León, Somoza's supporters began to seize local government, with the support of the National Guard kicking out Sacasa's supporters. Somoza's orchestrated "popular uprising" began in Bluefields, the city where the main customs houses, and thus the government's sources of revenue, were located. The Guard itself also began a purge of commanders."
 NW_NIC.14.a: "It's a disaster!"
 
 NW_NIC.15.t: "The Outcome of Agreements"
 NW_NIC.15.d: "No matter how much Somoza resisted, US support crushed his coup attempt. Now, taking into account the previous agreements between the liberal and conservative democratic parties, a single candidate, Leonardo Arguello, who was a member of the liberal party, was nominated on behalf of them.\n\nThe conservatives were guaranteed ministerial posts, which would allow a coalition of these two parties to take power and, after the elections of December 8, 1936, to establish a "Government of Consent" in the country."
 NW_NIC.15.a: "Democracy means a compromise"
 
 NW_NIC.16.t: "The New Elections"
 NW_NIC.16.d: "As expected, $NIC_Leonardo_Arguello$, the nominee of the two democratic parties, won a landslide victory in the election. With the support of Sacasa and the Liberal Party, he assumed the presidency, leading the "Government of Concord"."
 NW_NIC.16.a: "¡Larga vida al Presidente Arguello!"
 
 NW_NIC.17.t: "The Resignation of the President"
 NW_NIC.17.d: "Just five days after the coup began, the garrison of Leon was forced to surrender to the superior forces of the enemy.\n\nRealising that there was no one else to rely on, the president and his deputy resigned and went into exile, leaving the country decapitated, facing the threat of a military dictatorship.."
 NW_NIC.17.a: "Cowards!"
 
 NW_NIC.18.t: "Appointment of an Interim President"
 NW_NIC.18.d: "Nicaragua's Congress has appointed an interim president until the end of Sacasa's term - a little-known politician, Carlos Brenes Harkin, whom Somoza had previously proposed as his candidate for the presidency. Realising the absurdity of the situation, Congress "elected" Harkin without a secret ballot - with a standing ovation.\n\nThe State Department was forced to recognise the new government on the grounds that it was in control of the situation in the country."
 NW_NIC.18.a: "We all know who's really going to lead the country now..."
 
 NW_NIC.19.t: "A One-gate Election"
 NW_NIC.19.d: "Sakasa, who left the country and "resigned", was no longer influential, nor was the vice-president. Following them, the head of the Liberal party, who had left the country, was also out of power, resulting in the absence of any opposition candidate in the elections, which, despite a low turnout of 49.8 per cent, led to an automatic victory for General Somoza!"
 NW_NIC.19.a: "¡Viva el Presidente Somoza!"
 
 NW_NIC.20.t: "Somoza's Inauguration"
 NW_NIC.20.d: "Anastasio Somoza, who took office as president of Nicaragua, in his first message to Congress, finally fleshed out his campaign slogans.\n\In particular, by ordered democracy he meant strict and effective governance and the maintenance of internal peace through a "disciplined" National Guard. Only the Guard can prevent Nicaragua from sliding dangerously into chaos and demagogy.\n\nHe also strongly opposed the spread of "exotic ideas" in Nicaragua, primarily communism. Communism carries class enmity, which does not exist in the country.\n\nSocial justice was understood to mean the defence by the state of the interests of workers, peasants, entrepreneurs and capitalists, and the maintenance of a balance between their interests."
 NW_NIC.20.a: "Finally, we have a bright future ahead of us!"
 
 NW_NIC.21.t: "Arm Sales from Nicaragua"
 NW_NIC.21.d: "[FROM.GetName] has asked us to sell new infantry equipment for their army."
 NW_NIC.21.a: "We'd love to sell it."

 NW_NIC.26.a: "$NW_NIC.23.a$"
 
 NW_NIC.27.t: "Edwards' Plan Has Been Failed"
 NW_NIC.27.d: "There are many problems in our economy, and the Edwards Plan has not solved them all. As a result, the Managua Chamber of Commerce and the Agrarian Association of Nicaragua, an association of large agricultural producers, have openly spoken out against the Edwards Plan, demanding its cancellation. \n\nOur Leader was to agree with the arguments of entrepreneurs and cancel the current economic development program.."
 NW_NIC.27.a: "Americans don't want our prosperity..."
 
 NW_NIC.28.t: "The Fall of the Córdoba Exchange Rate"
 NW_NIC.28.d: "After the failure of the Edwards Plan, a new economic policy was introduced whereby exporters could sell 80 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings on the market by themselves at the actual exchange rate.\n\nIt would seem that this decision should improve the situation of the economy, but it did the opposite - the córdoba exchange rate fell to the level of 5.9 to 1 dollar, which did not satisfy the importers, and it was changed again. Apparently, this currency instability is our new scourge for the coming years."
 NW_NIC.28.a: "It's deplorable."
 
 NW_NIC.29.t: "[FROM.GetName] Reneged on the Bryan-Chamorro Treaty"
 NW_NIC.29.d: "The current President of Nicaragua [FROM.GetLeader] refused to honour the Bryan-Chamorro treaty, obliging them to return Big and Little Corn Island to their control."
 NW_NIC.29.a: "Well, to hell with them!"
 
 NW_NIC.30.t: "Activities of the Nicaraguan Labour Party"
 NW_NIC.30.d: "In 1913, the Central Labour Association of León was founded. In 1918, the Nicaraguan Workers' Federation was founded in the same city, which quickly spread to other departments. In the same year, in Managua, the Workers' Organisation was formed, whose leader was the intellectual Sofonias Salvatierra, who represented General Augusto Sandino during the peace negotiations in 1933.\n\nThese early trade union organisations established links with Mexican trade unions, which were already under the influence of the Mexican Labour Party. The Nicaraguan Workers' Federation also participated in the Central American Trade Union Congress held in El Salvador in 1918. In 1920, the Federation of Women Workers also emerged. In the same year, influenced by the Bolshevik Revolution, the intellectuals of the NWF founded the Socialist Group, which edited the newspaper El Socialista. This was the first expression of a political break with the tenets of radical liberalism.\n\nThis small growth of trade union organisations was led by self-taught craftsmen and radical liberal intellectuals. The social base of these early organisations reflected a progressive but confused level of consciousness that sought to break with the control of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This desire for political independence, reinforced by the world recession, led to the creation on 7 August 1931 of the Nicaraguan Workers' Party, which took positions that combined unionism, nationalism and anti-imperialism. In the 1932 elections, the NWP called for a boycott of the elections under the slogan: "Against the elections, in favour of Sandino". In 1933, the newspaper El Germen, the unofficial representative of the NWP, was published, and in 1934 it was replaced by the newspaper Causa Obrera. On 11 February 1934, NWP leaders Carlos Leclair, Roberto González, Justo Solórzano and Jesús Maravilla Almendárez met with General Sandino during his trip to Managua. However, after Sandino's assassination, on 21 February 1934, part of the leadership of the NWP began to slowly turn towards General Anastasio Somoza, who by the time he came to power had raised the discourse in favour of workers' rights and therefore "social justice". It was not a sudden turn, but a gradual, imperceptible one.\n\nIn 1935, "Causa Obrera" was replaced by "El Proletario". In his strategy to build a popular social base that would allow him to come to power, General Somoza García, as director general of the National Guardia, combined repression with flattery and the recruitment of trade union leaders.\n\nNow, part of the NWP opposes our policies, but another wing has strengthened its dependence on us by giving in to fees and favours. Obviously, if we don't want future problems with the Communists, it is necessary to levelling their influence through repression."
 NW_NIC.30.a: "The red vermin!"
 
 NW_NIC.31.t: "Arrest of NWP Leaders"
 NW_NIC.31.d: "Several leaders of the Nicaraguan Workers' Party were arrested for their participation and incitement during the Drivers' strike. To prevent them from influencing party activities even indirectly from prison, they were imprisoned on the island of Corne, near the Caribbean coast."
 NW_NIC.31.a: "The Red Hydra has lost some of its heads."
 
 NW_NIC.32.t: "Split in the Ranks of the NWP"
 NW_NIC.32.d: "Taking advantage of the absence of the party leaders, we managed to lure some of the leading leaders to our side, thus forming two wings of the party in the NWP. One of which supports us and the other tries to be independent. Having realised our plan, we took the conflicts in the party to a new level, paralysing their activity."
 NW_NIC.32.a: "The heads of the Red Hydra clutched together."
 
 NW_NIC.33.t: "Dissolution of the NWP"
 NW_NIC.33.d: "Taking advantage of our favour, a few months ago, the leadership of the PNR held the first congress of the party in the palace of the Managua City Hall in full legality. Eduardo Narvaez, the leader of our wing's supporters in the party, became the new general secretary.\n\nThis success led Narvaez to announce today the dissolution of the PPR, effectively putting power in our hands."
 NW_NIC.33.a: "The Red Hydra is dead"
 
 NW_NIC.34.t: "The NWP Organises Workers and Students"
 NW_NIC.34.d: "The Communists were able to pull themselves together and organised an anti-fascist organisation called the Congress for Peace, Unity and Liberation. This congress brought together workers, students, and representatives of the urban population, creating strong support for the Communists among society."
 NW_NIC.34.a: "Let the National Guard crush them!"
 NW_NIC.34.b: "What do they can?"
 
 NW_NIC.35.t: "The NRM is Pulling Farmers Together"
 NW_NIC.35.d: "Following the creation of the Congress, the Anti-Fascist Workers' Block emerged, and later the Inter-Union Workers' Council was created. As a result, these trade union currents joined forces and formed the Organising Committee of the Confederation of Nicaraguan Workers, which made it possible to organise the first Workers' and Farmers' Congress, which was immediately enriched by farmers, agrarians and landowners.\n\nThis was a breakthrough for the NWP, since until then farmers had been reluctant to join the left-wing currents, and now they had essentially become the monopoly of their opinions."
 NW_NIC.35.a: "We'll take their land!"
 NW_NIC.35.b: "$NW_NIC.34.b$"
 
 NW_NIC.36.t: "NWP Moves a Vote of no Confidence"
 NW_NIC.36.d: "The Nicaraguan Workers' Party, with the support of almost all sectors of society, expressed a vote of no confidence in the president of the republic.\n\nOf course, their demands were ignored, which immediately led to popular demonstrations, during which many people were injured, and the president was forced to flee from his palace, because some of the National Guard, who came from the lower strata of society, joined the communists, raising guns against their own officers.\n\nAfter the news of the president's escape became known, the leaders of the independent wing of the NWP announced that a revolution had taken place in the country, bringing the Communist Party to power."
 NW_NIC.36.a: "Viva la revolución!"
 
 NW_NIC.37.t: "$NIC_opposition_in_the_party_idea$"
 NW_NIC.37.d: "Unfortunately for us, despite the success of the party and the apparent failure of the former government, some of our members have sided with the enemy.\n\nFrom taking bribes to trivialising the government, these are only a small part of their sins. Moreover, they continue to rock the boat, hindering the construction of the new state."
 NW_NIC.37.a: "They are the traitors to the revolution!"
 
 NW_NIC.38.t: "Nicaraguan Communists Inspire Workers"
 NW_NIC.38.d: "The Workers' Party of Nicaragua, which staged a revolution in their country and seized power, set an example for the workers of our countries, who strengthened their activities, inspired by the success of their colleagues in Nicaragua."
 NW_NIC.38.a: "They don't stand a chance!"
 NW_NIC.38.b: "We have our own example!"
 
 NW_NIC.39.t: "The Unfinished Revolution"
 NW_NIC.39.d: "Nine years ago, the interference of the American government in the internal affairs of our country was so great that they essentially established a military occupation.\n\nThe Black Spike Pact, signed at the time by the liberal and conservative parties, recognised the continuity of the conservative government under the control of Adolfo Díaz Recinos, the occupation forces of the US Marine Corps, and General Moncada as commander of the armed forces.\n\nHowever, one of the liberal generals, Augusto Sandino, was not satisfied with this and refused to surrender his arms in exchange for the promised benefits, at the same time instilling in the peasants of the country's northern provinces a sense of rejection of US intervention. He thus turned a fratricidal civil war between liberals and conservatives into a national war against the occupation and the governments of the conservative Díaz and the liberal Moncada.\n\nThis war lasted for many years, until General Sandino and some of his loyal generals were eliminated by the National Guard on Somoza's orders, thus decapitating the revolutionaries. However, one of Sandino's military commanders, Seventh Division General Pedro Altamirano, survived. Known for his bloodthirstiness, he took refuge in the north of the country, in a mountainous area, supported by local peasants.\n\nIt is not known how long it will take for him to return to action, but one thing is certain: the Sandinista revolutionary army will start moving again as soon as it is ready."
 NW_NIC.39.a: "Sandino has left an unpleasant legacy..."
 
 NW_NIC.40.t: "The Sandinista Revolution is Gaining Momentum"
 NW_NIC.40.d: "Despite our efforts, the revolutionaries who had been driven into the mountains managed to recruit new volunteers from local peasants sympathetic to the guerrilla cause. This helped General Altamirano to restore his division to its former strength."
 NW_NIC.40.a: "This is just a division."
 
 NW_NIC.41.t: "The Sandinista Revolution is Growing"
 NW_NIC.41.d: "The mountains did not stop the Sandinistas for long, and their influence spread beyond the region. By sending out recruiters to rural villages, the guerrillas recruited a second division, albeit poorly trained."
 NW_NIC.41.a: "It's becoming a problem."
 
 NW_NIC.42.t: "The Sandinista Revolution has Regained its Former Strength"
 NW_NIC.42.d: "After the second division, the revolutionaries began to intensify the training of recruits, at the same time extending their influence to seven divisions. It is obvious that it is time for us to take decisive action, otherwise it could be disastrous for us, for the guerrillas have brought their numbers to the same level as they were when General Sandino led them."
 NW_NIC.42.a: "It's necessary to get ready."
 
 NW_NIC.43.t: "The Attack of the Revolutionary Army"
 NW_NIC.43.d: "Our inaction and unwillingness to shed the blood of our fellow citizens played a cruel trick on us. The Revolutionary Army led by Pedro Altamirano went on the attack. After immediately defeating the scattered National Guard in the northern provinces, they marched briskly to the capital and captured the presidential palace, seizing control of the main city.\n\nOf course, the current government was forced to flee abroad, while the rebel army hurried to take control of the southern provinces to prevent the continuation of resistance."
 NW_NIC.43.a: "Viva el General Sandino!"
 
 NW_NIC.44.t: "The Beath of General Pedro Altamirano"
 NW_NIC.44.d: "Our long-standing plan to infiltrate the Sandinista army finally paid off. We bribed one of the guerrillas, who turned out to be General Altamirano's stepson, Ventura Sequeira.\n\nEarly in the morning, while the general was sleeping, the guerrilla crept up to him and fired a shotgun, killing the old man with a single shot. Following this, National Guard troops struck the alarmed camp, defeating the remnants of the Sandinista army."
 NW_NIC.44.a: "We're done with this story."
 
 NW_NIC.45.t: "Long-Awaited Peace"
 NW_NIC.45.d: "Today is an important day for our country. A parliamentarian was sent to the guerrillas operating in the north of the country and managed to reach an agreement with the Sandinistas, who agreed, under certain conditions, to stop their activities and return to their daily routine.\n\nThis agreement means that the long-awaited peace has finally arrived in our country and that General Sandino's ten-year war is over."
 NW_NIC.45.a: "Our people have waited a long time for this."
 
 NW_NIC.46.t: "Proposal of the Central American Section"
 NW_NIC.46.d: "General of the Sandinista Revolution, [FROM.GetLeader], standing at the head of the Central American Section of the 4th International, approached us with a proposal to merge our sections into one!"
 NW_NIC.46.a: "This is a nice idea!"
 NW_NIC.46.b: "We have another intentions!"
 
 NW_NIC.47.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] denies us"
 NW_NIC.47.d: "[FROM.GetLeader] rejected our initiative to merge our Sections into one."
 NW_NIC.47.a: "This is sad news."
 
 NW_NIC.48.t: "$NW_NIC.29.t$"
 NW_NIC.48.d: "$NW_NIC.29.d$"
 NW_NIC.48.a: "$NW_NIC.29.a$"
 NW_NIC.48.b: "Who said that we agree?"
 
 NW_NIC.49.t: "The USA Refuses to Hand over the Islands"
 NW_NIC.49.d: "The USA has refused to return the Corne Islands and cancel the treaty. We probably have no choice but to accept it, or else.... to risk."
 NW_NIC.49.a: "$NW_NIC.29.a$"
 NW_NIC.49.b: "So we bring them back by force!"
