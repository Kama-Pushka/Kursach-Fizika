 ### EVENTS
 tibet.1.t: "Organizing the search for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation"
 tibet.1.d: "Two and a half years ago, the last Dalai Lama passed away. After death, each lama is reborn in Tibetan lands. As the central figure of our faith, his search is a top priority for the regent and his government. In this regard, the regent convened a national assembly to begin the search for the new reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The regent told the assembly about his visions last year at Lake Lhamolazzo. He saw in its reflection the letters "a," "ka," and "ma," a monastery with a turquoise roof, a pagoda with a gilded roof, and a path leading east to a bare hill opposite a house with a blue roof. The vision was deciphered to mean that the Lama's soul turned east after his death and was reborn in Amdo, a province formerly belonging to Tibet. But the regent's words did not convince everyone of the veracity of his visions. Some of the assembly, led by Lönchen Langdung, insisted that the Lama had been reincarnated here in Lhasa. He claimed that his nephew was the reincarnation because one of the previous Dalai Lama's horses, having escaped from the stables, ran toward Yapshi Langdung's ancestral home, as if after a long separation from its owner."

The assembly voted almost unanimously to remove the regent and appointed a new man to take his place: Landun, who was less authoritative and more controlling."

After appropriately testing the candidate with various relics and toys of the previous Dalai Lama, he said: "That's mine, that's mine!"

 tibet.40.t: "A new regent must be chosen"
 tibet.40.d: "After the current regent has decided to resign his post, what remains to be decided is to whom to pass it on? Jampel was leaning toward the candidacy of Daz Avang Songrao, an elderly monk who would not manage to gain enough influence in a few years to hold the post upon Jampel's return. But there is another option. There have long been rumors in the West of a certain Dalai Lama of the West who would not have enough support in our country. Who better to raise a new Dalai Lama than another Dalai Lama?"
 tibet.40.a: "The best educator of the Dalai Lama would be an old monk"
 tibet.40.b: "The best educator of the Dalai Lama will be another Dalai Lama"

Our country is prospering, people are happier, and now it's not just monks and llamas, it's everyone who matters! But when we look around we forget about the other Buddhists, that they are not as happy as we are in other countries. We must rectify this, and help them free themselves, as our people once did! We may not have found Shambhala, but we can create it, right here in this country!"
 tibet.41.a: "A speech worthy of the wisest lama"
 
 tibet.42.t: "Arrival of the British Mission"
 tibet.42.d: "A British mission has arrived in Lhasa, intending to arrange for a radio bridge with Britain. So also in the group is Brigadier Nim, who has agreed to evaluate our country's army."

 tibet.43.t: "Departure of the British Mission"

 tibet.43.a: "This will help us"
 
 tibet.44.t: "Scandal among the Lhasa aristocracy"
 tibet.44.d: "The Kama Sutra, fully translated into Tibetan, was recently published in Tibet, causing a scandal among the aristocracy. The author of the work was a monk named Gendun Chompel. He had published controversial works before, but this time he crossed the line!"

 tibet.45.t: "Arrival of the expedition of the Third Reich"

 tibet.48.d: "Losar is the Tibetan holiday of the New Year. It is one of the favorite folk festivals of Buddhism, during which many interesting things happen: ritual dances of beasts and skeletons, the black hat dance, the sword dance, stage battles between good and evil, torchlight performances and the Tsam New Year mystery, in which various historical and mythological characters take part."
 tibet.48.a: "It's a beautiful holiday"
 
 tibet.49.t: "Phuntsok Wangyal's Address to Kashag"
 tibet.49.d: "A young English teacher from Kham, the former region of Tibet, appealed to Kashag for equipment to prepare the uprising in Kham and to return the region to our country."

Despite his leftist views, he took a favorable view of some of the Lamas' interventions and seemed to have a generally positive view of Buddhism.\n\n\nAfter the speech, the national assembly and the Kashag gave him the authority to carry out these reforms. Perhaps the reasoning behind this was to move the regent, the annexation of Xikang lands, or maybe his armed men at the door? \n\nWho knows..."
