 YEM_weak_feodal_state:0 "Backward Feudal-Tribal State"
 YEM_weak_feodal_state_desc:0 "Although progress has come a long way, it has barely touched Yemen. The country is still divided into many rival tribes, and the way of life differs little from that of their ancestors hundreds of years ago."
 YEM_mandat_covenant:0 "Covenant Mandate"
 YEM_mandat_covenant_desc:0 "According to the Zaydite doctrine of the covenant mandate, after the imam's death, his successor should be chosen by the council of elders from among all people who are worthy of the title, regardless of their degree of kinship with the previous ruler. In addition, the overthrow of the Imam is considered legitimate if it is proven that he has shown injustice and violated the law, or if someone more suitable claims his position. Although Imam Yahya Hamid-ud-Din sought to abandon the covenant mandate system by formally appointing his son Ahmed as crown prince, this Zaydite tradition still serves as a convenient excuse for intrigue against the ruler."
 YEM_soviet_yemen_treat:0 "Soviet-Yemeni Treaty"
 YEM_soviet_yemen_treat_desc:0 "The Soviet-Yemeni Treaty of Friendship and Trade was concluded on November 1, 1928. With this agreement Imam Yahya hoped to strengthen the position of Yemen as an independent state. In addition, this treaty facilitated some trade with the USSR, although the entry of any foreigner into the country required the personal permission of the Imam. From Soviet Russia, much-needed foodstuffs and machine tools arrived in Yemen, and Arab coffee and incense were sent back."

 YEM_strengthening_imam_power:0 "Strengthen the Power of Imam Yahya"
 YEM_strengthening_imam_power_desc:0 "From the beginning of his reign, Yahya bin Mohammed Hamid-ud-Din has sought to maximize central authority, ruthlessly cracking down on opposition and carrying out brutal raids on rebellious tribes. The Imam's rule is extremely conservative and autocratic, every detail, no matter how small or trivial, must be approved by the Imam, even if it is moving a government truck to Taiz or giving fodder to mules."
 YEM_support_jews_emigration:0 "Support Jewish emigration"
 YEM_support_jews_emigration_desc:0 "For a long time, a law passed in 1922 under pressure from other Arab countries formally forbade Jews from immigrating from Yemen. But there is no place for Jews among our country's population, which is already divided between Sunni and Shiite mezhabs, zaydites and Ismailis. We should allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine if they pay all their debts and sell their property. Experienced artisans should also train Yemenis in their trade."
 YEM_close_eyes_on_jews_emigration:0 "Turn a Blind Eye to Jewish Emigration"
 YEM_close_eyes_on_jews_emigration_desc:0 "In 1922, under pressure from other Arab countries, Yahya formally forbade members of Yemen's Jewish community to leave the country. In fact, however, the Imam turned a blind eye to Jewish immigration to Palestine through the Aden protectorate. We should continue this policy in order to get rid of the Jewish community in our country and to take control of property formerly owned by Jews."
 YEM_supress_jews_emigration:0 "Suppress the Emigration of Yemeni Jews"
 YEM_supress_jews_emigration_desc:0 "For a long time the Imam turned a blind eye to the emigration of Yemenite Jews through the Aden protectorate to Palestine. This not only weakened the position of our Arab brethren in Palestine, but also deprived us of many experienced artisans. We should increase control over the Jewish community."
 YEM_send_students_to_lebanon:0 "Send Students to Lebanon"
 YEM_send_students_to_lebanon_desc:0 "Despite his deliberate policy of isolation and the preservation of a virtually medieval system, Imam Yahya is aware of the need to build a modern army and train competent officials. To this end, we should form a group of students from the sons of the most loyal members of the nobility to go to Lebanon for training."
 YEM_kuttabs:0 "Kuttabs" #Kuttabs
 YEM_kuttabs_desc:0 "Kuttabs are the only source of education for the people of Yemen. These Muslim schools teach reading, writing, grammar, and the Quran.

 YEM_open_technological_school_desc:0 "In the current climate, there is an increasing need for qualified professionals. We cannot always limit ourselves to sending students abroad, where young men are effectively out of our control and may join oppositional circles. We need to establish our own technical school."
 YEM_build_cement_fabric:0 "Construction of the First Cement Plant"
 YEM_build_cement_fabric_desc:0 "Under the terms of the treaty of friendship, the Soviets promised to build a cement plant on Yemeni territory, which would help us significantly speed up the construction of infrastructure. The project was scheduled to begin in 1941, but we could insist on an earlier construction of the plant."
 YEM_build_agricultural_school:0 "Build an Agricultural School"
 YEM_build_agricultural_school_desc:0 "Agriculture is the backbone of Yemen's economy. However, although the fertility of our land stands out compared to the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, we have to import a large part of our provisions from India. The creation of an agricultural school will help make our agriculture more efficient, which in turn will allow a larger percentage of the population to move beyond subsistence farming."
 YEM_extend_soviet_yemeni_treaty:0 "Extend the Soviet-Yemeni Treaty"
 YEM_extend_soviet_yemeni_treaty_desc:0 "The Soviet-Yemeni Friendship and Trade Treaty of 1928 was one of the first indications of international recognition of our state. Although the Imam never succeeded in negotiating the supply of Soviet arms to Yemen, trade between the two countries reached a relatively high level. In addition, in 1929 in San'a the opening of the General representative office of the USSR «VostGosTorg» (Eastern State Trade) for the Red Sea countries, and in 1931 the Soviet specialists deployed the first automatic telephone exchange in Yemen.\nThe Soviet-Yemeni treaty expires November 1, 1938, we should extend it. But it is worth bearing in mind that the USSR will not be able to continue cooperation in the event of a major war."

 YEM_export_of_yemeni_coffee:0 "Export of Yemeni Coffee"
 YEM_export_of_yemeni_coffee_desc:0 "Yemen was one of the first countries to cultivate coffee, perhaps the very first. This drink has a special place in the life of the Arabs, especially the Bedouins, as a symbol of generosity and hospitality. But Yemeni coffee is known far beyond the Arabian Peninsula and is one of our main export items."
 YEM_extend_italo_yemeni_treaty:0 "Extend the Italian-Yemeni Treaty"
 YEM_extend_italo_yemeni_treaty_desc:0 "According to the Italian-Yemeni Treaty of Friendship of 1926, Italy recognized the independence of Yemen, undertook not to interfere in the internal affairs of our country, agreed to supply us with industrial equipment and goods, as well as to send technical personnel.

 YEM_expand_treaty_of_taif:0 "Extend the Treaty of Taif"
 YEM_expand_treaty_of_taif_desc:0 "The 1934 Treaty of Taif settled relations between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. For the final establishment of the actual borders between the countries, it is necessary to add annexes to the agreement confirming the Saudis' control over Jazan and the division of the Najran region by Wadi Najran."
 YEM_denounse_treaty_of_taif:0 "Denounce the Treaty of Taif"
 YEM_denounse_treaty_of_taif_desc:0 "In 1934, an unsuccessful attempt to control Asir and Najran almost resulted in Yemen's loss of independence. It was only under international pressure that the Saudis halted their attack on San'a. The Treaty of Muslim Friendship and Arab Fraternity concluded in Taif forced Yemen to renounce its claims and agree to a twenty-year truce with the Saudis. It was time to avenge their past defeat and denounce the shameful treaty."
 YEM_invasion_of_asir:0 "Invasion of Asir"

 YEM_denounce_treaty_of_sanaa_desc:0 "Before the war with Saudi Arabia, Yahya signed the San'a Treaty with the United Kingdom, securing the withdrawal of Yemeni troops from the Aden protectorate and confirming the Imam's renunciation of claims to the British zone of influence. But we cannot watch quietly as the British gradually enslave the many small sultanates of South Yemen. The time has come to denounce this shameful treaty with the colonizers."
 YEM_violet_line:0 "Violet Line" # Violet Line
 YEM_violet_line_desc:0 "The border between Yemen and the British protectorate of Aden, the so-called «Violet Line», was established during Turkish rule by the Anglo-Osman agreement of 1914. Since then, Imam Yahya has repeatedly tried to extend his influence beyond this boundary, seeking to revive the Great Yemen. In 1934, however, the British finally drove Yemeni troops out of the Aden protectorate. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past and concentrate on the development of our legitimate territories."
 YEM_support_anti_british_sentiment_in_aden:0 "Support Anti-British Sentiments in Aden"
 YEM_support_anti_british_sentiment_in_aden_desc:0 "The United Kingdom actively imposes its orders on the territory of the Aden protectorate. The numerous local sultans, emirs and sheikhs are unable to resist British pressure and sign agreements that make them powerless puppets of London. It is time to take advantage of our rulers' fame as fighters against colonialism and push the peoples of the Aden Protectorate into revolt."
 YEM_support_kathiri:0 "Support the Kathiri Sultanate"
 YEM_support_kathiri_desc:0 "The Kathiri Sultanate is the last bastion of Yemeni influence in the Aden Protectorate. The Sultans of Seiyun have only formally recognized the domination of the British and have been at war with the Qu'aiti Sultanate, which is supported by the United Kingdom, for nearly a century. However, it has long been clear that the Kathirians' dreams of domination in Hadramaut were not destined to come true. The Sultanate has lost its access to the sea, undermining its economy and ability to procure arms. We can use the unmarked desert border to bring our troops into Kathiri to strengthen their defense."
 YEM_subjugate_hadramaut:0 "Subjugate Hadramaut"
 YEM_subjugate_hadramaut_desc:0 "Hadramaut was once part of the Zaydite Imamate, but, like the rest of the country, it disintegrated into small sultanates. The time had come to unite Hadramaut under Yemeni rule."

 YEM_repress_shabab:0 "Repressions Among Shabab"
 YEM_repress_shabab_desc:0 "After the defeat of the war with Saudi Arabia in San'a and other urban centers, a generation of young intellectuals (consisting of the sons of Yemeni officials and large landowners, some of whom were graduates or teachers at the Imam schools in San'a) known as shabab began discussing topical issues. The reading groups turned into circles of dissent, and the shabab became the most ardent critics of the Yahya regime. The growth of opposition sentiments cannot but worry the Imam, the main ideologues of the opposition should be arrested."
 YEM_assasination_of_imam_yahya:0 "Assassination of Imam Yahya"
 YEM_assasination_of_imam_yahya_desc:0 "The secret organization of the Committee of Struggle managed to organize a successful assassination attempt on Imam Yahya and seize power in San'a.

 YEM_tighten_autocracy:0 "Tighten Autocracy"
 YEM_tighten_autocracy_desc:0 "The Imam's power is unlimited, but various discussion clubs and reformist newspapers can still exist quite calmly in the provinces. Strict censorship of the entire press must be enforced and all pockets of freethinking must be eradicated."
 YEM_proclaim_imam_ahmed:0 "Proclaim Ahmed bin Yahya Hamid-ud-Din as Imam"
 YEM_proclaim_imam_ahmed_desc:0 "Ahmed bin Yahya managed to mobilize the tribes against the rebels who had killed his father. The new imam, previously interested in the ideas of the reformists, vowed after coming to power that he would not die until he had stained the sword with the blood of the modernists. Ahmed set out to continue Yahya's policy with only limited reforms. This, coupled with the brutality and highly fickle nature of the new Imam, makes it clear that Yemen will remain a backward, medieval state for years to come."
 YEM_creation_of_council_of_ministers:0 "Create a Council of Ministers"
 YEM_creation_of_council_of_ministers_desc:0 "After the suppression of the modernist uprising, the new Imam is nevertheless forced to carry out some reforms.

 YEM_expansion_of_waqf_property_desc:0 "The Shafi'i living on the outskirts of Taiz expressed active support for the rebels during the uprising of the Constitutionalists of the Committee of Struggle. The fertile, irrigated land should be taken away from the wealthy Shafi'i, which would officially constitute a fund of Waqf lands, donated for religious purposes. In reality, these lands will go entirely to the ownership of the Imam and a garden plantation will be established on them by Useifir *this shit doesn't even have an English version, have some respect*."
 YEM_open_secular_school:0 "Open the Secular Schools"
 YEM_open_secular_school_desc:0 "The construction of several secular schools will satisfy the demand for modern education by some members of the nobility, and at the same time protect young people from the temptation of receiving an education abroad."

 YEM_defence_pact:0 "Defensive Pact with Egypt and Saudi Arabia"
 YEM_defence_pact_desc:0 "The time has come to end the isolation of Yemen and begin to establish relations with Arab countries. In particular, Saudi Arabia and Egypt are likely to be willing to sign a defense treaty with us to strengthen the unity of the Arab world against the colonial threat."
 YEM_proclaim_imam_ibrahim:0 "Proclaim Ibrahim bin Yahya Hamid-ud-Din as Imam"
 YEM_proclaim_imam_ibrahim_desc:0 "For a long time Ibrahim bin Yahya had nurtured plans to overthrow his father, and his dreams finally came true. Yemen would finally be freed from oppressive rule and would embark on a course of breaking out of isolation and initiating economic reforms."

 YEM_khat_coltivation_ban:0 "Ban the Cultivation of Khat"
 YEM_khat_coltivation_ban_desc:0 "Chewing khat leaves has been extremely popular throughout Yemen for centuries. This light drug is actually a substitute for alcohol, which is banned in Muslim countries. Khat is often used by soldiers to stimulate attention and banish sleep. The various negative consequences, from a strange hyperactivity to, on the contrary, apathy and depression, do not scare Yemenis, not to mention blackened teeth and the risk of death. Abdullah al-Waziri believes that emergency legislation is needed to ban the use of green poison and to order the uprooting of all its trees."

 YEM_free_prisoners_of_imam_desc:0 "Like many Arab rulers, Imam Yahya kept many prisoners of honor in the capital, among whom the largest proportion were the children of tribal sheikhs held hostage. This allowed him to keep most of the nobility under his control and to raise the heirs of the Bedouin clans loyal to the Imam. After the revolution, however, the influential families above all expect us to democratize social relations and release the hostages of the past ruler."

 YEM_decentralization:0 "Decentralization"
 YEM_decentralization_desc:0 "For a long time Yemen was under the brutal autocratic rule of Yahya. Everything in the country, even the distribution of fodder to the king's mules, required the Imam's nod. The freedom-valuing tribes were no longer willing to tolerate extortion and tyranny. Extensive autonomy for the Bedouin clans would greatly increase their loyalty."
 YEM_call_shafits_into_army:0 "Call the Shafi'i and Isma'ili to the Army"

 YEM_stop_isolation:0 "End the Isolation"
 YEM_stop_isolation_desc:0 "Although Imam Yahya was convinced that only isolation would protect Yemen's traditional values and spiritual bonds, in reality it has only slowly weakened our country, making it an increasingly easy target for colonizers.

 YEM_create_system_of_education:0 "Secular Primary and Secondary Education"
 YEM_create_system_of_education_desc:0 "A well-established network of kuttabs makes it possible to teach literacy to a large proportion of the population, but the creation of a modern state requires a system of secular education in which students can acquire a much broader range of knowledge about the world."

 YEM_operation_of_copper_and_coal_mines_desc:0 "Yemen has coal and copper reserves that are hardly exploited. The transfer of concessions to Arab and European companies to exploit these deposits will greatly increase our treasury revenues, which will contribute to the development of our economy."

 yem.1.t:0 "Roots of our Kingdom"
 yem.1.desc:0 "The history of modern Yemen dates back to 1918, when Zaydite imam Yahya Hamid-ud-Din proclaimed country's independence from the collapsed Ottoman Empire. \n\nNew monarch began a policy of strengthening the Yemeni central government, brutally suppressing numerous uprisings of the tribes. Although the Sunnis and Shia Ismailis were unhappy, that power in the country actually passed into the hands of the tribes inhabiting the northern part of the country, that adhere to the Zaydite version of Shiism, imam and king of Yemen at the same time, Yahya gained a reputation as a skilled military warlord and leader of the liberation movement. \n\nYahya began active expansion, seeking to restore the possessions of the Zaydite Imamate, that controlled the lands from Dhofar to Asir in the 17th-18th century. The successes of the Yemen's Imam's movement to create an independent centralized state shook British dominance in the region. Only at the cost of great efforts did London manage to retain control over the Aden Protectorate, which consisted of many small sultanates, sheikhs and emirates controlled by the British. Imam Yahya's expansion was fully stopped only in 1934, after the defeat in the war with Saudi Arabia..."

 yem.2.t:0 "Shadows of 1934 War"
 yem.2.desc:0 "Even before the war with Saudi Arabia, to ensure the security of the rear, Imam Yahya agreed to withdraw troops from the Aden Protectorate and signed the San'a Treaty with the United Kingdom, establishing boundaries between Yemeni and British dominions. As a result, the country actually lost its influence over the Aden Protectorate, retaining only contacts with the Kathiri Sultanate, which only formally recognizes the power of the British and for almost a hundred years has been at war with the sultanate of Qu'aiti, loyal to London. \n\nStarted in 1934, the Saudi-Yemeni border war turned out to be extremely unsuccessful for Yahya. Abdulaziz's troops not only prevented the Imam from gaining control of the Emirate of Asir and the Principality of Najran, but even captured the western coast of Yemen, including Hodeida. However, under the international pressure, Saudis were forced to abandon plans to storm San'a and sign «Islamic friendship and Arab brotherhood» with Yemen, that proclaimed the end of war. As a result, Imam Yahya was forced to abandon claims from claims to disputed border areas of Asir, Jizan and part of Najran. In its turn, Ibn Saud returned the Yemeni territories occupied during the war. Both countries pledged to keep at least twenty years of peace with each other. \n\nAfter the defeat in the war with the Saudis, dissatisfaction with the brutal and authoritarian rule of the imam began to rise in Yemen. The dissatisfaction of the intelligentsia, in particular, was caused by Yahya's policy of isolating the country, in which the personal permission of the imam is required for the entry of each foreigner. In San'a and other urban centers, a generation of young intellectuals (consisting of the sons of Yemeni officials and large landowners, some of whom were graduates or teachers of the imam's schools in San'a), known as the shabab, began to discuss actual topics. Reading groups have become circles of dissenters, and shabab have become the most outspoken critics of the Yahya regime."

The imam liked the report received and even recommended the school to the Egyptian educational delegation. Lately, though, Yahya has been receiving more and more letters from angry conservatives, who claim that in this Dubhan school they not only study ungodly sciences, but also harbor conspirators who spread seditious ideas about reforms.

Not only that, but on the basis of al-Madrassa al-Ahliyya local discussion center for current events, known as the Reform Group, has formed. However, neither Numan nor his discussion group, consisting mainly of peasant farmers, did not oppose the power of Imam Yahya and did not dare to cooperate with the Struggle Committee, therefore, most likely, after several months of house arrest, Numan and his supporters will be released.
