Imam al-Khalili, although he is the richest man in Oman, does not eat anything other than what ordinary people eat.\nToday, the imam's wife, who is also quite rich, brought him a bowl of rice at dinner. Mohammed al-Khalili asked where she got it. Wife replied: «I bought rice with my own money out of pity for you, because I'm afraid that the food you eat with other people will harm your health. Nothing gets into our stomachs that was not available to the people before the prices went up»."

    NWoman.11.desc:0 "The first days of treatment showed a significant improvement in the imam's vision. Mohammed al-Khalili was very pleased with his doctor. However, today a conflict broke out between Toms and the imam. The doctor decided to take a photo of al-Khalili, but he said that this is unacceptable for orthodox Muslims. Dr. Toms replied, «I am responsible if it is unacceptable, because I am the one who is doing something unacceptable, not you». However, the Imam said that if he allowed the doctor to take a photo, it would help him to commit a sin.\nAfter that, Toms decided to hide behind the door and secretly take a photo of al-Khalili as he left the mosque, but the imam noticed the doctor, grabbed him by the neck and threw him to the ground. As a result, Toms returned to Muscat without payment, and Mohammed al-Khalili was never able to fully restore his eyesight."

Against this background, the representatives of Imam al-Khalili suggested that we conclude peace and recognize the unification of Muscat and Oman under the rule of the imamate.\n\nThe best solution would be to demand that the imamate conclude an alliance treaty in exchange for peace. In this way, we will be able to partially restore our influence in the region, without getting involved in a protracted war. However, the imamate authorities may reject such a proposal."
