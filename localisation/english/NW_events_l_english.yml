It is known that the officer has several serious disciplinary offenses, which were once overlooked.

 TRpolitical.1.t: "Trotskyism on the rise"
 TRpolitical.1.d: "«All over the world workers revolt against oppressors, but in the state [Root.GetName] even those who supposedly have developed class consciousness sit back and wait for changes from within the political system, which is rotten so much that only a revolution can save us from it!»\n\nThis is what the new voices [Root.GetAdjective] of the Trotskyite movement say. They consider the ruling party [Root.GetRulingParty] a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and demand its removal by any means. Whether these means will be internal or external is not yet clear."
 TRpolitical.1.a: "Even in government there may be supporters of such ideas"
 TRpolitical.1.a.tt: "Increases the chance of international support for the Trotskyite coup"
 TRpolitical.1.b: "A popular movement must seek the support of the people"
 TRpolitical.1.b.tt: "Increases the chance of popular support for the Trotskyist uprising"
 TRpolitical.2.t: "Supporters of Trotskyism in Government"
 TRpolitical.2.d: "Although in general the ruling party [Root.GetRulingParty] is a categorical opponent of revolutionary socialism and keeps a watchful eye on left-wing radicals, there are people in the government who are ready, at least, to take into account the opinion of the part of the population that sees in the Trotskyist ideology the solution of all problems, and not to bring the situation to the civil war. \n\n Although [Root.GetLeader] and its supporters may consider them traitors, these are the people who can make the revolution bloodless if it finally comes."
 TRpolitical.2.a: "We'll look after them, too, for a number of reasons"
 TRpolitical.2.a.tt: "With sufficient popular support, a coup can be carried out"
 TRpolitical.3.t: "Trotskyites make a coup"
 TRpolitical.3.d: "The people demanded the Trotskyist revolution so fiercely and loudly that many political currents were lurking in wait. Now the wait is over: while [Root.GetRulingParty] and the army were preparing to suppress the popular uprising, [Root.GetAdjective] was placed under house arrest by several members of the government, after which they began negotiations with the rebels.\n\nThese negotiations were conducted under the pretext of maintaining public order, but in reality their task was to distribute posts in the new socialist state for those who were ready to cooperate. The coup d'etat was rapid, and all those who might have opposed the new regime were executed, arrested or exiled."
 TRpolitical.3.a: "The waves of history wash away the past"
 TRpolitical.4.t: "[Root.GetName] experiences class conflict"
 TRpolitical.4.d: "The Trotskyist revolutionary movement, previously supported only by marginal intellectuals and desperate rebels, suddenly began to gain popularity among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The very fact that more and more people are ready to classify themselves as belonging to some "class" shows that the ideas of Marxism-Trotskyism have not only spread among those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] mourns such a reversal of public opinion and grieves for those times when the word "[Root.GetAdjective]" was important for people. It seems that the revolution is already happening in society at various levels, and it is impossible to stop this process."
 TRpolitical.4.a: "People can call themselves whatever they want"
 TRpolitical.5.t: "Soldiers desert and go to the red guerrillas"
 TRpolitical.5.d: "«Capitalists and nationalists want you to shed blood on the front for them and kill your brothers because of disputes that have nothing to do with the working man! Instead of going against the workers fighting for freedom in their country with weapons in their hands, wrap it up against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!»\n\nThe army, which used to be a bulwark of patriotism and loyalty, was vulnerable to Trotskyite propaganda, rapidly spreading in the state [Root.GetName]. Soldiers desert, refuse to fight for their homeland, and sometimes even join the partisans, who claim to be preparing a revolution"
 TRpolitical.5.a: "Maybe they just want to live differently"
 TRpolitical.6.t: "[GetMonth] - time of revolution"
 TRpolitical.6.d: "There is a growing perception in the state [Root.GetName] that the Trotskyist movement meets the aspirations of the people, and in recent months, support for the Communists has increased significantly. But those who now call for a revolution are no longer just militants or disgruntled trade unionists. The movement is led by a group organized enough to form a government if the coup succeeds.\n\n However, if the revolution starts now, the state [Root.GetName] is likely to be plunged into civil war. Are revolutionaries so impatient that they will risk tearing the country in half, or should they wait for a better opportunity?"

It is no longer just a political theory, but a real movement that brings together both disgruntled workers and some celebrities. The Trotskyites call it class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] party calls it the direct path to revolt and treason.\n\n The Trotskyites have no faith that the [Root.GetLeader] leader will want to implement the reforms they propose, so they demand an immediate referendum on the change of power. We can still try to drag public opinion to our side, but if the attempt ends in failure, it can lead to a revolution"

So far, the voices of Trotskyite politicians are not so loud, but the movement is expanding, there is no doubt about it. \n\n The opinion of the nation's leaders is divided.

 TRpolitical.701.desc: "Appearances of public discontent that previously only occurred in certain places now happen everywhere. As long as people take to the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] party is at a crossroads, Trotskyites believe that it is too weak and cannot adequately govern the state.

It was a painful blow to some representatives of the military leadership supporting the Trotsky ideas, whose belligerent positions and pompous speeches are now being laughed at by everyone. \n\n At one time it seemed that the growing Trotskyite sentiment could become a threat to the [Root.GetRulingParty] party, but now [Root.GetAdjective] Trotskyism is increasingly seen as ridiculous extremism and an attempt to destroy the fundamental values of a nation - the very nation they supposedly wanted to elevate."

The working class, which was supposed to be the driving force of the revolution, decided that it had more important things to worry about than the overthrow of [Root.GetLeader]: apparently the example of other revolutionary powers did not inspire him much.

After a long debate and attempts to find out whose industrial development plan was better, some delegates drew the attention of other participants to the fact that disputes do not lead anywhere, but only make the situation worse.

There is an opinion that it is time for us to overcome our differences and recognize the social-democratic parties as useful and necessary elements for strengthening the working-class movement. Perhaps we should consider the role of social democracy from a position where it plays the role of a transitional political element, as socialism does, in relation to communism.
