The heir answered, that he always lacked fatherly love - the Shah, wishing to grow up a strong future monarch, limited the communication of Mohammad with his mother and he himself was rude to his son.

Unable to withstand what happened, the Shah committed suicide himself.\n\nThe new Iranian monarch, who will be crowned, is his youngest son Ali Reza, but it seems that he is still completely unprepared for government. Everyone understands that in fact the reins of power will be taken over by the queen Tadj ol-Molouk."

No one doubted that it was necessary to overthrow the power of the oppressors of the Pahlavi clan, but when we were supported by the heir to the throne, Mohammad, some came to the conclusion that Iranian society was not ready for such a radical change. Perhaps it is worth preparing the way for modernization and putting at the head of the country a fictitious monarch who supports socialist ideas."

The newly formed Iranian government has similar problems, so they have proposed to us, to form from the fragments of Kurdistan lands and peoples, a single Republic of Mahabad, which will act as a republic that will accommodate all the Kurds."
    NWpersian.424.a: "We would benefit from that"
    NWpersian.424.b: "We are not interested"
    
    NWpersian.425.desc: "The problem of the Azerbaijani people has been plaguing our country for years. The new Iranian government is experiencing similar problems, so they suggested that we form a single Azerbaijani republic out of the fragments of Azerbaijani lands and peoples, which will act as a republic that will accommodate all Azerbaijanis."

    NWpersian.426.t: "Unrest among Islamists"
    NWpersian.426.desc: "News of a new law calling for more women's rights has spread across the country by blazing fire. The conservative part of the population is not ready for such drastic changes as a woman walking down the street without a burqa, or praying next to a man. Strikes against this law began across the country, and stones were thrown at women who went out in the street without burqas."

    NWpersian.428.t: "The formation of a new doctrine"
    NWpersian.428.desc: "The negative reaction of Islamists to the new policies of our party, has led to a split in the ranks of our party as well. Mohamed Nakhshab, who opposed the weakening of Islam in the country, created his own party, the Socialist Theological Movement. He was the first Iranian to try to integrate Shiites into socialism. In his writings, he openly defended Shiism over the leftist movement, arguing that a synthesis of the two teachings, could produce a strong doctrine and a strong Islamic world."
    NWpersian.428.a: "What nonsense!"
    
    NWpersian.429.t: "The theological movement is gaining strength"
    NWpersian.429.desc: "In the wave of outrage that erupted, the newly formed Socialist Theological Movement began to gain strength, and even the Communists, who had a strong position, lost their confidence as they looked at the crowds marching through the streets calling for the repeal of laws against the will of Allah."

Realizing that they would not get their way peacefully, conservatives joined the popular position of the theological movement, and moved with them against the current government."

    NWpersian.432.t: "The Returning of Lahak Khan Bavand"
    NWpersian.432.desc: "Once a rebel officer against the Shah, after being defeated along with his soldiers he was exiled to the USSR, where he studied artillery craft at the Red Army's Frunze Military Academy and even received the rank of major. However, he refused to join the party, arguing that despite the attitude of the Iranian authorities to him, he still remained loyal to his country.\n\nSeeing the situation in the country, our comrades from the USSR sent him and a thousand Iranian soldiers loyal to him to support our forces."
    NWpersian.432.a: "This will help achieve victory!"

A few hours later, the sailors were already disarming and surrendering their weapons.\n\nProbably the sailors realized that even if Pahlavi was able to leave, he would not be able to pay for their service and maintain an entire fleet."
    NWpersian.433.a: "It's their right"
    
    NWpersian.434.t: "Iran has returned the islands of the Strait of Hormuz"
    NWpersian.434.desc: "Taking advantage of the absence of ships in the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian Navy took advantage of the situation, and took back control of the islands: Abu Musa, Lower and Upper Tombs.\nObviously, this means that Iran has begun to build up its naval forces in the region, and may play against us in the future. Even though these islands are not particularly important to us, we have to be more careful in this region from now on."
    NWpersian.434.a: "This is a minor loss"
    
    NWpersian.435.t: "Suppression of Islamist unrest"
    NWpersian.435.desc: "The tensions over the issue of Islamic values reached their climax, and people who came out on the street with placards, came out with guns in their hands.Thanks to the units formed by the current government, this crowd was dispersed and disarmed with few casualties, so conservatives who joined the popular position of theological movement, were defeated following the troublemakers. It showed the strength of our government, and in whose hands is the truth!"
    NWpersian.435.a: "Judgment awaits them all!"
