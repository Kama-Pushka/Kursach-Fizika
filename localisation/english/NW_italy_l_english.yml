He viewed revolution not as an economic or social fact, but as an act of will. The masses must be involved in the revolution, but they will not become anarchists until the revolution has already started. Anarchists must approach the masses and accept them as they are, without necessarily imposing any authoritarian pedagogical projects, but rather by adapting the anarchist ideology to their sensibilities. Revolutionary action has two aspects: the violent destruction of obstacles to freedom and the gradual spread of a practice of freedom that is devoid of coercion."

Malatesta was opposed to all forms of revolutionary terror, which he believed would inevitably lead to dictatorship. He also rejected the Marxist idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat and was highly critical of the outcome of the Bolshevik revolution, which brought an end to the experiment of the Soviets and established an authoritarian state."

Under capitalist production, the citizen was alienated from their labor, and confined to a certain type of activity. Now that individuals are interested in the results of their labor, they can no longer be limited to the former type of production, as was the case under the Mussolini government.\n\nThe bold experiment proposed is to abandon the capitalist principle of the division of labor to the greatest extent possible. The anarchist development of the economy is moving towards the re-employment of people in unlimited forms of production, mastering more and more activities. The communes could become the first territory in the world to realize this new economic principle."

On the other hand, opportunistic members of the bourgeoisie may try to use the new institution to pursue their own interests and participate in community life. To attract citizens who are ready to work under any conditions for the good of their people, we may need to break with the radical anarchists."
