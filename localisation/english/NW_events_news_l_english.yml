 ## В МИРЕ ОДНА ИДЕОЛОГИЯ
 trworldnews.999.t: "[GetNewsHeadline]Triumph of the [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] ideology in World"
 trworldnews.999.desc1: "Truly joyful and inspiring news has spread all over the world today! Absolutely all countries of the world have taken the path of democracy!\nThis means that there are no longer cannibalistic regimes, that the rights of everyone are fully respected! This is a really great day!"
 trworldnews.999.desc2: "Today, the information Bureau has informed the proletarians of all countries that we have finally achieved the world revolution that Marx, Engels and Lenin spoke about for so long and consistently.\n\nAbsolutely all countries of the world today stood under the red working banners, swearing allegiance to the new society!\nIn the near future, a world Congress will be held to decide on the formation of a new unified «World Federal Republic of Soviets», which Lenin once spoke of and which will unite all the Communist countries under its flag into one state."
 trworldnews.999.desc3: "Great news! The relatively recent ideology of fascism has spread around the world in a matter of decades, and now fascists of all stripes and all countries can celebrate victory! Absolutely all countries have taken the path of the fascist dictatorship!\n\nDespite the fact that our fascist countries have many claims to each other, today we forget about our differences and all exult in a single rush!"
 trworldnews.999.desc4: "An incredible and unexpected piece of news has crept up on us. Absolutely all countries of the world have chosen authoritarianism as their way of development!\n\nThis is really incredible and means only one thing: no more extreme trends, only a calm moderate development under the leadership of a sensitive head of state who knows his business!"
 trworldnews.999.desc5: "A great day has come. Where until recently the country was ruled by dictator, radical or proponent of the preservation of the old orders, now ruled by science. The peoples of the world are celebrating the establishment of a new political order all over the world! A system where everyone is in his or her own place and is only responsiblefor what he himself knows!\n\nThe technocrats of all countries are jubilant in a single impulse! Already in the near future a world congress will be held, where the question of forming a single «World Technate» will be solved, which will unite all technocratic countries under its flag into one state."
 trworldnews.999.desc6: "The great revolution has been accomplished! What the Trotskyists of all countries have been striving for for so long, what the workers of all countries have given themselves up for, has finally happened!\n\nThe world revolution, about which Marx, Engels, and Lenin spoke so long and consistently, was finally accomplished thanks to the efforts of the Trotskyists of all countries!\nIn the near future, a world Congress will be held to decide on the formation of a new unified «World Soviet Republic», which will unite all Trotskyist countries under its flag into one state."
 trworldnews.999.desc7: "Today, the monarchical form of government has prevailed in the whole world! After centuries of devastating revolutions that toppled monarchies one after another, we finally got our revenge and returned to the right path of development along the road of monarchy.\n\nLong live the old order! They have always given society a confident and moderate progress without any shocks, in contrast to the unstable political regimes of any republics."
 trworldnews.999.desc8: "Just think! Until recently, the anarchists did not even have their own territory free from state oppression, and today the whole world has finally and irrevocably got rid of the state!\n\nThis rapid result shows the real interest of society in anarchists and the desire to overthrow the oppressor in the person of the state.\nToday, society is on the path to the final consolidation of anarchic success!"
 trworldnews.999.a: "Long live the [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun]! Go to new heights!"
 trworldnews.999.b: "Long live the monarchy! Go to new heights!"
