 NW_marco_polo_bridge.10.a: "So they want war"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.11.t: "Refusal to negotiate"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.11.d: "Through a messenger at the Marco Polo Bridge, the Chinese side has forwarded to us a letter in which General Sun Zheyuan has refused to apologize for the incident that occurred. In addition, we never received any information about our soldier at the Wanping Fortress."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.11.a: "So they want war"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.12.t: "Cessation of Hostilities"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.12.d: "The Japanese army has stopped the escalation of conflict at Marco Polo Bridge. It seems that the seemingly inevitable war with Japan has managed to bypass us this time. It is true that we should not expect Japan to stop its attempts to take control of the lands of Northern China. Most surprisingly, a Japanese soldier on the grounds of Wanping Fortress was indeed found and turned over to the Japanese side."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.12.a: "We will try to continue to find common ground with them"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.13.t: "Continuation fighting"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.13.d: "Despite general attempts to resolve the incident peacefully, Japanese artillery resumed shelling Wanping this morning, and their troops moved forward over the bridge. Perhaps the last chance to stop the Japanese invasion will be the departure of Song Zheyuan and his replacement by Zhang Zizhong, who was negotiating with the Japanese side."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.13.a: "We are resigning"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.13.b: "The Japanese have made it clear that they are not ready for a peaceful solution"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.14.t: "Personnel changes in Hebei-Chahar"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.14.d: "It seems that the Chinese are still trying to resolve the incident peacefully: General Song Zheyuan has resigned from all his posts and Zhang Zizhong has become the new head of Hebei-Chahar, which we hinted at during the negotiations."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.14.a: "In that case, cease hostilities"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.14.b: "Time to achieve our goals with war"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.15.t: "Incident at Marco Polo Bridge"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.15.d: "Near Beijing, near the Marco Polo Bridge, hostilities have broken out between the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin and units of General Song Zheyuan's 29th Army, head of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, established as a buffer state formation between Japan and China. We have no exact information as to what caused the conflict itself, but perhaps the time has come for us to try to stop Japanese imperialism. This decision will be supported by all of China."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.15.a: "We will help the 29th Army"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.15.b: "General Sun has himself to blame for what happened"
 marco_polo_bridge_flag: "Incident at Marco Polo Bridge happened"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.16.t: "Formation of the United Anti-Japanese Front"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.16.d: "Today the central government of the Republic of China in Nanjing called upon all citizens of the country to unite in the face of the Japanese threat. To this end they propose to cease internal strife and, under the command of the Nanjing government, to fight back the Japanese invasion until the last Japanese foot leaves Chinese soil."
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.16.a: "This is a wise decision"
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.16.b: "We don't care" 
 NW_marco_polo_bridge.16.c: "This alliance is unlikely to last"
