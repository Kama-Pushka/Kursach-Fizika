 #Estonia
 EST_era_of_silence:0 "The Era of Silence"
 EST_era_of_silence_desc:0 "With the violent ultra-nationalist Vaps movement sweeping from Saaremaa to Võrumaa, the State Elder must usher in a new era for Estonia; an era with no elections, no dissent, and no resistance. The nation must enter an era of silence."
 EST_ismaaliit:0 "Isamaaliit"
 EST_ismaaliit_desc:0 "With even Päts’ own party banned from all political offices in the country, the dictatorship needs a new party to organize itself around. The Patriotic League will protect the nation from all threats; both inside and outside of Estonia’s borders."
 EST_establish_the_rahvuskogu:0 "Establish the Rahvuskogu"
 EST_establish_the_rahvuskogu_desc:0 "With the old Constitution of Estonia proving incapable of protecting its people from fascism and tyranny, it has been decided that a new constitution must be drafted to secure the nation and, in time, restore the democratic traditions that the Estonian people fought and died for in 1918."
 EST_chamber_of_deputies:0 "Secure the Chamber of Deputies"
 EST_chamber_of_deputies_desc:0 "With the National Council now firmly under the control of Isamaaliit, all that remains is to gain control of the Chamber of Deputies. With all chambers of the civilian government under absolute majority of the party, the dictatorship will gain uncontested control of the nation and its industries."
 EST_exploit_the_banks:0 "Exploit the Banks"
 EST_exploit_the_banks_desc:0 "Konstantin Päts has long been an influential figure in the Estonian banking sector. While some would make the treasonous assertion that Päts has had a hand in corrupting the banks and exploiting the working people of Estonia, Päts’ connections in the private sector places our dictatorship in the perfect position for some exploitation of our own."
 EST_modernize_capital:0 "Modernize Tallinn"
 EST_modernize_capital_desc:0 "The great city of Tallinn has for too long been held by the wretched claws of German and Russian suppressors and has yet been able to reach its full potential as the envy of the Baltic. Our great city has never and will never be scorched or desecrated by foreign armies, and must be modernized to compete with the other cities of Europe."
 EST_squash_the_opposition:0 "Squash the Opposition"
 EST_squash_the_opposition_desc:0 "With our control of the civilian government complete, we must remove all black seeds of treachery from our cabinet and local governments. Those who oppose our leadership must soon learn that to oppose Isamaaliit is to oppose Estonia."
 EST_formalize_baltic_entente:0 "Formalize the Baltic Entente"
 EST_formalize_baltic_entente_desc:2 "The Baltic Entente is an agreement between ourselves and our Baltic brothers to protect one another in times of war, but the sincerity to which this agreement is held up is questionable at best. With the Germans and Soviets breathing down our collective necks, and the British far from our shores, cooperation has never been more vital to maintaining our fragile independence."
 EST_look_north:0 "Look North"
 EST_look_north_desc:0 "We are aware that the Baltic States alone may not be enough to resist the scourge of the Nazis and Soviets on our border, but with our aggressors’ Scandinavian ambitions, perhaps we may be able to persuade our northern allies to join the Baltic Entente."
 EST_beyond_the_baltic:0 "Beyond the Baltic"
 EST_beyond_the_baltic_desc:0 "Though some would insist that the Baltic Entente is enough to protect our small nation from invasion, we all truly know this to be a fallacy. The Allies aided us in 1918 in our struggle for self-determination, and perhaps it would not be so foolhardy to expect them to come to our aid yet again!"
 EST_join_the_allies:0 "Join the Allies"
 EST_join_the_allies_desc:0 "The Allies have proven themselves to be a friend to [ROOT.GetAdjective] independence, and all that remains now is to formalize that friendship with [ROOT.GetNameDef]’s official entry into the Allied faction."
 EST_national_council:0 "Secure the National Council"
 EST_national_council_desc:0 "The National Council is the branch of our government which represents the local municipalities, cities, and corporate chambers. If we are to properly represent the interests of these people, we must ensure that their representatives are loyal Isamaaliit party members and military staff only; for only they are capable of defending the sovereignty of the Estonian people."
 EST_new_economic_policy:0 "Revisit the Economic Policy"
 EST_new_economic_policy_desc:0 "Our economy is almost entirely dependent on trade with the USSR. The Russians are outright enemies of Estonian self-determination and for as long as we depend on them for anything, we are not truly free. We must detach ourselves from our oppressors for a more truly independent economy."
 EST_support_independent_militaries:0 "Support Independent Militaries"
 EST_support_independent_militaries_desc:0 "All throughout the nation, independent military factions are raring to charge into battle to protect Estonia from foreign imperialism again, but what these militaries have in spirit they lack in resources. We must provide all soldiers, official or no, with the resources needed to defend our good nation."
 EST_fight_the_vaps:0 "Fight the Vaps"
 EST_fight_the_vaps_desc:1 "The right-wing Vapsid movement seek to disrupt the stability of Estonia. Though the movement began as a group of veterans and national heroes, but it has quickly devolved into an ultranationalist movement which [EST.GetLeader] would compare with the Nazis. These rogue elements within our nation must be expunged if we are to create a stable future for Estonia."
 EST_republican_defence_league:0 "Republican Defence League"
 EST_republican_defence_league_desc:0 "With the Vaps dwindling in significance, many paramilitary groups now are lost and without a cause to fight for. By attempting to unite these paramilitaries into one official Estonian group, we shall tap on a new resource of brave men willing to fight and die for Estonian independence."
 EST_womens_defence_league:0 "Women's Defence League"
 EST_womens_defence_league_desc:0 "The Naiskodukaitse is a sub-organization of the Republican Defence League for patriotic women willing to do their part to defend their home and their families. It is vital that the Women’s Defence League is properly equipped and invested in to provide our home with a garrison and our troops with medical staff."
 EST_corporate_chambers:0 "Corporate Chambers"
 EST_corporate_chambers_desc:0 "Leftists have long opposed the idea of corporatism, but now that the Riigikogu has been rid of their incessant voices, we may finally establish the Corporate Chambers. Workers will be divided not by ideology but by vocation, with private employers representing their interests to the dictatorship. What could go wrong?"
 EST_cave_to_enemy_pressure:0 "Cave to Enemy Pressure"
 EST_cave_to_enemy_pressure_desc:0 "It has become clear that there is no future wherein both our nation and our people survive. Although we have done much to protect our kin, it has become clear that there is no way [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] can maintain her independence without great loss to her people."
 EST_threat_on_our_border:0 "The Threat on Our Border"
 EST_threat_on_our_border_desc:0 "War is on the horizon. We don’t know what for, and we don’t know who we’ll be fighting, but we know the hawk of war has its talons primed for [Root.Capital.GetName] and we must decide where our allegiances lie in the oncoming struggle. Plans must be drawn, with a focus on either the Nazis in the South or the Soviets to the East."
 EST_fortify_tallinn:0 "Fortify Tallinn"
 EST_fortify_tallinn_desc:0 "Though many would like to believe that we can hold the entirety of the Estonian border, realistically we know that some ground must be sacrificed if we are to survive. Forts around the capital will allow us to protect the core of our infrastructure, no matter the cost."
 EST_hold_saaremaa:0 "Hold Saaremaa"
 EST_hold_saaremaa_desc:0 "We must be prepared for a long and arduous resistance. Though the Estonian archipelago lacks the industry of the mainland, preparing the isles for a last stand will give us a base of operations with which we may support resistance fighters and, in time, retake our home."
 EST_fortify_the_border:0 "Fortify the Border"
 EST_fortify_the_border_desc:0 "We will meet our enemies at the border and have faith that our brothers in Latvia and Lithuania will not fall. However ambitious this plan may be, we must not let a single foot of ground be subject to Soviet or German occupation ever again."
 EST_fight_against_communism:0 "No Surrender"
 EST_fight_against_communism_desc:0 "We have already witnessed what life under enemy occupation is like and many of our men died fighting so that we would never have to see that again. With patriotism rife in our ranks, our armies will not fall quietly."
 EST_long_push_east:0 "The Long Push"
 EST_long_push_east_desc:0 "We hadn’t expected our campaign would go so well, yet here we are; rifles in hand and pushing into our enemy’s core territory. Their lands are vast and ours small, and it will be an arduous journey we must prepare for."
 EST_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare for the Inevitable"
 EST_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "We cannot hold out forever; it is crucial that we ready our government to go into exile and support [Root.GetAdjective] resistance efforts from afar."
 EST_forest_brothers:0 "The Forest Brothers"
 EST_forest_brothers_desc:0 "We hear stories of anti-communist militants all across the Baltic States hiding in the trees in the winter and conducting raid after raid on the occupying armies. We must establish communications with these freedom fighters and do what we can to support their efforts on Baltic soil."
 EST_prepare_underground_resistance:0 "Prepare an Industrial Resistance"
 EST_prepare_underground_resistance_desc:0 "Major factories all across [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] are shutting down and being captured by the enemy so it is vital that we seek industrial investments and equipment from abroad so that we may continue to produce weapons for our resistance; even if we must fight in secret."
 EST_prepare_covert_resistance:0 "Prepare a Covert Resistance"
 EST_prepare_covert_resistance_desc:0 "The resistance is more than just man and rifle; it is sabotaging supply lines, making contact with the resistance, and rendering our enemies scattered and confused while our bullets meet their targets. We must invest in [Root.GetAdjective] intelligence if we are to retake the homeland."
 EST_rally_the_nation:0 "Rally the Nation"
 EST_rally_the_nation_desc:1 "The Vaps Movement is a movement of veterans from the Estonian war of independence and we have been falsely stifled under the regime of Konstantin Päts. If we are to create an Estonia that works for Estonians, we must make ourselves known to the world. We must march across the nation and let everyone know, we are here. We are the men who fought for Estonia’s existence and we deserve to be heard."
 EST_march_on_talinn:0 "The March on Tallinn"
 EST_march_on_talinn_desc:0 "With so many veteran’s societies and paramilitary groups in Estonia already on our side, we remain confident that Konstantin Päts will be unable to resist us when we descend upon Tallinn. We will march to the Riigikogu and, in no uncertain terms, declare a Vapsid government united under Artur Sirk."
 EST_glory_of_war:0 "The Glory of War"
 EST_glory_of_war_desc:0 "We are a government of veterans, but many Vapsid members are simply too old or worn down by their injuries to return to active service. Perhaps these old war dogs may find a new purpose in training a new generation of Estonian soldiers in the ways of war."
 EST_mobilize_the_vets:0 "Mobilize the Veterans"
 EST_mobilize_the_vets_desc:0 "Many Estonian veterans were denied the right to sign up for active service for their association with the Vaps movement. Now that we have taken government, we may grant these men the right to serve."
 EST_vapsid_youth:0 "The Vapsid Youth"
 EST_vapsid_youth_desc:0 "The majority of the Vaps are far past their prime, but the young are entirely enthralled by the historic struggle for independence that characterized Estonia a few decades ago. By establishing a Vapsid Youth, we will give these enthusiastic young men a place where they may hope to recapture the glory of their fathers and grandfathers."
 EST_veterans_government:0 "The Veteran's Government"
 EST_veterans_government_desc:0 "The previous cabinet of ministers were weak-willed and bent to the wills of Konstantin Päts. We need a new cabinet of ministers, those who are sympathetic to the Vapsid cause."
 EST_anti_communist_militia:0 "Anti-Communist Militia"
 EST_anti_communist_militia_desc:0 "The nation is filled with men willing to fight the Bolshevik threat to our east but were rejected by the old government for being too radical. To the Vaps, no amount of anti-communist thought is too radical, and these men deserve a place in our army as much as any others."
 EST_reach_out_to_germany:0 "Reach Out to Germany"
 EST_reach_out_to_germany_desc:0 "If we could fight the Soviets with spirit and vigor alone, the USSR would be dismantled tomorrow, but sadly Estonia simply lacks the manpower to defend itself against such an overwhelming threat. Perhaps by aligning with the Germans, we may stand to survive into the next decade."
 EST_baltic_shield:0 "Baltic Shield"
 EST_baltic_shield_desc:0 "The Soviets wish to crush Estonia under the boot of imperialism, but we cannot allow that to happen. Bunkers must be constructed all along the border, we may not be able to defeat the Soviets, but we may at least stand long enough for someone else to."
 EST_join_the_axis:0 "Join the Axis"
 EST_join_the_axis_desc:0 "Now that the Germans have been assured of our intentions, we remain certain that Estonian entrance into the Axis should be entirely reasonable."
 EST_the_brotherhood:0 "The Brotherhood"
 EST_the_brotherhood_desc:0 "Estonia does not exist in a vacuum, and to our South lies two very vulnerable nations who would likely fare better at survival if they were integrated into the Estonian state. The Baltic States are brothers, and as brothers, we must stand together."
 EST_empower_finnish_militants:0 "Empower Finnish Militants"
 EST_empower_finnish_militants_desc:0 "The Vaps Movement would not have been possible without the assistance of Finnish veterans to the north. Finnish volunteers aided Estonia to gain her independence, and now these veterans, like us, seek to overthrow their weak-willed government and establish one which works for the Fins."
 EST_national_pride_in_finland:0 "National Pride Marches in Finland"
 EST_national_pride_in_finland_desc:0 "The Finnish veterans lack the organization that we had, so perhaps our mere passive support of them is not enough to bring about the change we saw in Estonia. By organizing marches in Finland, we may one day see our two nations united under the heroes of the last war."
 EST_finno_estonian_supremacy_league:0 "Finno-Estonian Supremacy League"
 EST_finno_estonian_supremacy_league_desc:0 "Now that the old Finnish government is a thing of the past, we may utilize the close interwoven connections we have made in the new Finnish government to create the foundation for a lasting friendship based on self-governance and anti-Bolshevik sentiment."
 EST_unite_our_nations:0 "Unite Our Nations"
 EST_unite_our_nations_desc:0 "With Finland now in the hands of its veterans, and our influence tightly woven into the very fabric of the new Finnish government, all we need do is pull a few strings and we shall be able to unite our people into a single nation."
 EST_sieze_swedish_assets:0 "Seize Swedish Assets"
 EST_sieze_swedish_assets_desc:0 "The Swedes sit on their assets doing nothing with it but supplying whichever power appears most intimidating to them. This squandering of Scandinavian resources can go on no longer, they must be brought into Estonian custody."
 EST_secure_the_straits:0 "Secure the Straits"
 EST_secure_the_straits_desc:0 "Denmark blocks our passage to the Atlantic and must be removed if Estonian ships are to tour the North Sea."
 EST_occupy_norway:0 "Occupy Norway"
 EST_occupy_norway_desc:0 "With Sweden and Finland in our pockets, all we need do is subjugate the Norwegians and the entirety of mainland Scandinavia will fall under Estonian control."
 EST_form_scandinavia:0 "Estonia is Scandinavia"
 EST_form_scandinavia_desc:0 "Many in the North view Estonia’s claim to the Scandinavian identity as little more than a joke, but with the entirety of the subcontinent now under our control, who is there left to laugh? With Sweden, Norway, and Denmark firmly under the boot of Estonia, nobody is here to stop us from claiming Scandinavia!"
 EST_proclaim_finno_ugra:0 "Proclaim Finno-Ugra"
 EST_proclaim_finno_ugra_desc:0 "With Finland now under our control, we stand in a unique position to consolidate the Finnic identity within our state. There are countless Finno-Ugric peoples across Northern Europe and by uniting this identity, we stand to bring countless new soldiers to fight for the Vapsid cause."
 EST_unite_the_sami:0 "Unite the Sami"
 EST_unite_the_sami_desc:0 "The Sami are a disparate and widely oppressed people existing across Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. For too long, the Sami people have been denied the right to speak their Finnic language and they lack the manpower needed to fight against their oppressors. We must consolidate the Sami within our state to protect them from Nordic imperialism."
 EST_unite_karelia:0 "Unite Karelia"
 EST_unite_karelia_desc:0 "Karelia is full of Finnic people; from the Karelians themselves to the Eastern Sami people. With Finland under our control, we may yet be capable of expanding our state into Karelia and uniting the Finnic people therein."
 EST_unite_the_finnic_identity:0 "Unite the Finnic Identity"
 EST_unite_the_finnic_identity_desc:0 "With all major Fins in the Scandinavian subcontinent under our control, we are able to unite the Finnic identity and declare a new state that Estonians, Fins, Sami, Samoyeds, and all other Finno-Ugric people may call home."
 EST_break_the_silence:0 "Break the Silence"
 EST_break_the_silence_desc:0 "Konstantin Päts established this dictatorship under the guise of protecting Estonia from fascism and communism. Now that these ideologies have been pushed into irrelevance, there is little reason for the dictatorship to continue and free elections must be reopened."
 #Lithuania
 LIT_secure_a_loyal_cabinet:0 "Reconvene the Seimas"
 LIT_secure_a_loyal_cabinet_desc:0 "With the coup secured and Antanas Smetona’s control of the government absolute, it is time that we reconvene the Seimas to more efficiently govern the nation, with loyal ministers at the Dictator’s side."
 LIT_rastikis_military_reforms:0 "Rastiki's Military Reforms"
 LIT_rastikis_military_reforms_desc:0 "The military is ill-prepared to face a threat of the magnitude and severity that another German invasion would bring and it is vital that the military arm of the government bring competent leadership to the patriotic men of Lithuania’s army."
 LIT_patriotic_education:0 "Patriotic Education"
 LIT_patriotic_education_desc:0 "The education sector in Lithuania has seen better days, but we cannot allow ideas to run rampant amongst our youth. Young people must be properly educated as patriotic Lithuanian Catholics in fine institutions like the Rytas."
 LIT_soviet_mutual_assistance:1 "[SOV.GetAdjective] Mutual Assistance"
 LIT_soviet_mutual_assistance_desc:0 "Poland is the prime target of both the Soviets and the Germans, and everyone knows it. We’ve heard whispers that there are plans to partition Poland between the two powers, and perhaps we may be able to persuade the Soviets to seek Lithuanian support in their efforts in exchange for the return of Vilnius to its rightful owners."
 LIT_victory_in_trust:0 "Victory in Trust"
 LIT_victory_in_trust_desc:0 "There is nobody we can trust in our government; not Kazys Grinius, not Augustinas Voldemaras, not even Rastiki. Powerful men are cowardly and treacherous, but a rifle and a good man to fire it? That we can trust and that will bring us victory."
 LIT_integrate_the_opposition:0 "Integrate the Opposition"
 LIT_integrate_the_opposition_desc:0 "Although Antanas Smetona viewed the former government as a cabinet of inept politicians and Soviet sympathisers, it is hard to deny that there were a number of men of competence in their ranks and it would be foolish not to utilize them in the new Seimas."
 LIT_patriotic_socialism:0 "Patriotic Socialism"
 LIT_patriotic_socialism_desc:0 "The democratic government was largely composed of Social Democrats and centrists, and the ideals of socialism pollute the minds of the Lithuanian workers. While Kazys Grinius was clearly a socialist, there is no denying his patriotic spirit and perhaps by enacting some of his ideas, the Lithuanian worker may become both more productive and more supportive of the Dictatorship."
 LIT_peace_with_poland:0 "Peace with Poland"
 LIT_peace_with_poland_desc:0 "Officially, the war between Poland and Lithuania has been raging for decades, but neither side has engaged in combat for most of the duration of the war. Although Vilnius remains in their hands, we must turn this stalemate into a formal peace to focus on our true enemies to the East and West."
 LIT_strength_in_unity:0 "Strength in Unity"
 LIT_strength_in_unity_desc:0 "We stand strong when we are together and no two nations have had a bond like Poland and Lithuania. Though we shall never allow ourselves to become trapped in a Commonwealth again, perhaps our two nations may be able to cooperate as friends, protecting their fragile independence."
 LIT_indivisible_power_of_the_state:0 "The Indivisible Power of the State"
 LIT_indivisible_power_of_the_state_desc:0 "I am the state, the state is me. With the laws and rules of the dictatorship firmly established, all that remains is to ensure that the power of the dictator is absolute. Though some wish for a return to democracy, we know this to be a dangerous and foolhardy idea while the bear and the eagle’s collective breath is hot on Lithuania’s neck."
 LIT_purge_popular_resistance:0 "Purge Popular Resistance"
 LIT_purge_popular_resistance_desc:0 "There are rogue elements among our populace who would oppose Smetona and his dictatorship. These people are enemies to Lithuanian independence and must be eradicated to ensure the continued stability and survival of our nation."
 LIT_anti_communist_militia:0 "Anti-Communist Militia"
 LIT_anti_communist_militia_desc:0 "It is our ambition to rid our nation of leftist elements, and thankfully there are already volunteers all across the country who share our ambition. All we need do is support these anti-leftist organizations and they will do all the work of protecting against the Soviets for us!"
 LIT_arrest_nazis_in_memel:0 "Arrest the Nazis in Memel"
 LIT_arrest_nazis_in_memel_desc:0 "Memel is rife with Nazis and fascist sympathisers and it is creating a precedent for a German invasion. If we wish to hold the Memel region, then we must make Nazi party membership a crime punishable by imprisonment and make adequate preparations for a potential Nazi invasion."
 LIT_reminder_of_true_enemy:0 "A Reminder of the True Enemy"
 LIT_reminder_of_true_enemy_desc:0 "During the war of 1918, we faced brutal oppression by the Red Army and the Freikorps and with war looming on the horizon, the bitter sting of those memories are burning the minds of Lithuanian ministers. We cannot delay, we must decide which of these powers is our greatest threat and make adequate preparations for war!"
 LIT_appease_soviets:0 "Appease the Russians"
 LIT_appease_soviets_desc:0 "Though we have tried every effort to prepare for war, we must admit defeat if we are to preserve Lithuanian lives."
 LIT_appease_nazis:0 "Appease the Germans"

 LIT_offer_military_basing:0 "Offer Basing Rights"
 LIT_offer_military_basing_desc:0 "The last thing we want is another war. Lithuania offers strategic interest to both the Germans the Soviets and so perhaps by offering access and basing rights inside our nation as well as the ability to construct and use bunkers, we may avoid invasion."
 LIT_offer_military_basing_tt_1:0 "§GDepending on who has been appeased:§!\n"
 LIT_offer_military_basing_tt_2:0 "§ROR§!\n"
 LIT_occupation:0 "Occupation"
 LIT_occupation_desc:0 "It is too late for us. The country is rife with enemy soldiers who could choose to turn on us at any time. Perhaps it is time that our leaders and government resign and we allow our enemies to do with us what they will."
 LIT_free_voldemares:0 "Free Voldemaras"
 LIT_free_voldemares_desc:0 "Perhaps Smetona was too hasty in his arrest of his former Prime Minister. Voldemaras is clearly a friend to Lithuanian independence and we would be foolish not to utilize his skills and devoted public following within our government."
 LIT_lithuanian_activist_front:0 "Lithuanian Activist Front"
 LIT_lithuanian_activist_front_desc:0 "There are activists and paramilitary groups all across Lithuania, though they are disparate and segregated by ideology, but what they all share is the spirit to fight for Lithuania and preserve her independence. By establishing the Lithuanian Activist Front, we shall make Lithuania not such an easy target to be plundered by imperialist powers."
 LIT_organize_the_iron_wolf:0 "Organize the Iron Wolf"
 LIT_organize_the_iron_wolf_desc:0 "The Iron Wolf remains scattered and disorganized and, like Voldemaras himself, is undecided on whether they support the government or wish to overthrow it. By providing the Iron Wolf with a definitive vision and goal, we will make men out of these lost boys."
 LIT_new_kind_of_iron_wolf:0 "A New Kind of Iron Wolf"
 LIT_new_kind_of_iron_wolf_desc:0 "Now that the Iron Wolf threat has been dealt with, we may reclaim our national symbol and show it proudly throughout our armed forces."
 LIT_lithuanian_youth:0 "The Iron Wolf Youth"
 LIT_lithuanian_youth_desc:0 "The military needs men, but in these times of ideology, we need to plant patriotic ideas into the heads of our boys so that when they grow old enough, all they need is a rifle and they will gladly die for a single inch of Lithuanian soil."
 LIT_rapid_fortifications_in_the_east:0 "Rapid Fortifications in the East"
 LIT_rapid_fortifications_in_the_east_desc:0 "It’s clear that the most urgent threat to our continued independence is the communists and we must do all that we can to defend our nation from the threat that they pose."
 LIT_defence_from_above:0 "Defence From Above"
 LIT_defence_from_above_desc:0 "Our fortifications are utterly useless if the enemy continues to bombard them from the skies. We must prepare a defence and return fire into the air for every bomb and bullet dropped from above."
 LIT_exile_voldemares:0 "Exile Voldemaras"
 LIT_exile_voldemares_desc:0 "With Augustinas Voldemaras safely behind bars, one would think the threat of the bark of the Iron Wolf would have no bite, but his organization is still agitating for his release and are an active threat in the nation. If Voldemaras is freed but banished from ever entering Lithuania again, the Iron Wolf movement will inevitably lose traction and we will be freed from the threat they pose."
 LIT_root_out_the_iron_wolf:0 "Root Out the Iron Wolf"
 LIT_root_out_the_iron_wolf_desc:0 "Although exiling Voldemaras has halted future Iron Wolf efforts to overthrow the government, the organization still exists and these men must be pushed far off to the political fringes to ensure a stable future for Lithuania’s military."
 LIT_prepare_forest_brothers:0 "[Root.Get_Forest_Focus_Loc]"
 LIT_prepare_forest_brothers_desc:0 "[Root.Get_Forest_Focus_desc_Loc]"
 LIT_unify_the_military:0 "Unify the Military"
 LIT_unify_the_military_desc:0 "Some of the Lithuanian military have become entirely enchanted with Voldemaras and his Iron Wolf paramilitary group. So much so that all it would take is an invitation and almost the entirety of the Lithuanian military would come under Iron Wolf influence. With this, we would finally stand to oust Smetona from government and reclaim Lithuania!"
 LIT_seek_ties_with_germany:0 "Seek Ties with Germany"
 LIT_seek_ties_with_germany_desc:0 "Although officially an enemy to the Lithuanian state, Germany shares our enemy; Poland. By reaching out to the Germans, perhaps we will be able to reclaim our lost Lithuanian brothers currently occupied by the Poles."
 LIT_fortify_memel:0 "Fortify Memel"
 LIT_fortify_memel_desc:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted to defend Lithuanian sovereignty any more than a fox can be trusted to defend a coup! [GER.GetLeader] is an enemy of the Lithuanian state and it is no secret that Memel makes us a target for German aggression!"
 LIT_proclaim_greater_lithuania:0 "Proclaim Greater Lithuania"
 LIT_proclaim_greater_lithuania_desc:0 "Lithuania was once one of the greatest powers of Europe, but since we were cut down and neutered by the Poles all those centuries ago, we have been incapable of restoring our former glory, but no more. Lithuania will become Europe’s greatest power once again!"
 LIT_claim_livonia:0 "Claim Livonia"
 LIT_claim_livonia_desc:0 "Up north are two young states who have not known independence in centuries. They would surely be better guided by Lithuanian hands…"
 LIT_claim_lithuania_minor:0 "Lay Claim to Lower Lithuania"
 LIT_claim_lithuania_minor_desc:0 "The region the Germans falsely name “Königsberg” is actually an ancestral home of Lithuanians. Lithuania Minor has since the Baltic Crusades existed under the occupation of the Germans and it must be reclaimed."
 LIT_demand_vilnius:0 "Demand Vilnius"
 LIT_demand_vilnius_desc:0 "For too long, the traditional Lithuanian capital has been held by our enemies in Poland and our government has been too weak-willed to do anything about it, but no longer. Vilnius will be Lithuanian again!"
 LIT_support_polish_fascists:0 "Support Polish Fascists"

 LIT_invade_poland:0 "Invade Poland"
 LIT_invade_poland_desc:0 "For centuries, Lithuania was shackled in a so-called “Commonwealth” in which Poland held the majority of power. The Polish have been thirsty to return to this state of affairs, and perhaps it is time we have them the Commonwealth they desire."
 LIT_request_polish_occupation:0 "Request Polish Occupation"
 LIT_request_polish_occupation_desc:0 "For the past few decades, the idea of a Polish state that does not include Lithuania was described as unthinkable and Lithuanian sovereignty was something of a joke to contemporary Polish politicians, so perhaps they would be perfectly satisfied with a Lithuanian occupation of their pitiful nation."
 LIT_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"

 BALTIC_align_paramilitarists_desc:0 "There are many paramilitary groups throughout [Root.GetNameDef], most of which are devoted solely to the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] self-determination. While admirable, it would be preferred if these groups were to see us not as [SOV.GetAdjective] puppets, but as the logical continuation of the [Root.GetAdjective] state."
 BALTIC_influence_neighbours:0 "Influence the Neighbours"
 BALTIC_influence_neighbours_desc:0 "Although not nearly as popular as it was before the wars of independence, the concept of a freed Baltic under socialism is as old as the concept of Baltic self-determination itself.

 BALTIC_belarus_ssr_desc:0 "The concept of uniting Belarus and the Baltic is not a foreign one.

 BALTIC_focus_on_the_interior_2_desc:0 "It is vital that we do not forget the absolute brutality that the Freikorps brought to [Root.GetNameDef] so many years ago.

 BALTIC_united_baltic_ssr:0 "A United Baltic SSR"
 BALTIC_united_baltic_ssr_desc:0 "Though distinct in culture, language, and identity, there has long been a brotherhood and comradery between all three Baltic States.

 BALTIC_end_swedish_neutrality_desc:0 "What the Swedes call neutrality is nothing but weakness; bending to the whims of whichever power seems most powerful at the time with little regard for the wellbeing of the lower classes across their borders. Such a weak-willed and flimsy government is unworthy of sharing our border and we must create a new Sweden with the spine to defend its people from tyranny."

 SOV_freedom_of_debate_unity_of_action_desc:0 "The complexities of governing a country and steering it on the right path are many, and so alternatives must be able to be discussed openly. Once a decision is reached, however, it is the duty of every member of the politbureau and indeed the entire party to support that decision without reservation."
 SOV_the_construction_of_communism:0 "The Construction of Communism"
 SOV_the_construction_of_communism_desc:0 "The Construction of Communism will come with its own challenges and obstacles. With the Politbureau standing united behind Comrade Stalin, we can take the first steps to build Communism."

 SOV_addressing_internal_affairs:0 "Addressing Internal Affairs"
 SOV_addressing_internal_affairs_desc:0 "While the revolution still has many enemies around the world, and many millions of workers still long to be liberated, we must not forget to turn our eyes towards the many issues awaiting us at home."
 SOV_nkvd_primacy:0 "NKVD Primacy"
 SOV_nkvd_primacy_desc:1 "Until we can be sure that all enemies of the state are accounted for, we must continue to rely on the NKVD to protect the revolution."
 SOV_the_new_soviet_woman:0 "The New Soviet Woman"
 SOV_the_new_soviet_woman_desc:0 "The political revolution brought freedom to millions of people in our Union, first among them the millions of women who are no longer confined to just being wifes and mothers, but who can now also stand as fully equal in the workplace as well."
 SOV_expand_the_agitprop:0 "Expand the Agitprop"
 SOV_expand_the_agitprop_desc:0 "To reach the millions of workers throughout our Union, we must speak their language. We must make our arguments simple and easily understandable, so that they remain in the memory of the common citizen. We should further expand our efforts in this area."
 SOV_positive_heroism:0 "Positive Heroism"
 SOV_positive_heroism_desc:1 "While all accomplishments by members of the working class are shared by all members of the working class, we can still point to individuals as examples that others should emulate."
 SOV_revive_the_stakhanovite_movement:0 "Revive the Stakhanovite Movement"
 SOV_revive_the_stakhanovite_movement_desc:0 "Cruel exploitation drives the worker in capitalist countries to push themselves harder and produce more for those who own the factories. In our country, workers like Alexey Stakhanov drive themselves further because they know that every extra brick laid, every extra ton of coal mined, every extra rivet put in place helps build a world in which the workers are free from exploitation forever."
 SOV_war_heroes:0 "War Heroes"
 SOV_war_heroes_desc:0 "Russians have always been able and willing to perform deeds of extreme bravery in the cause of defeating any invader of the motherland. While we are united in our struggle against the enemy, we should not pretend that there aren't some soldiers in our military who have gone far beyond the call of duty."
 SOV_collectivist_propaganda:0 "Collectivist Propaganda"
 SOV_collectivist_propaganda_desc:1 "The many challenges facing us never face any citizen alone. All our struggles are shared struggles, consequently, all our achievements are shared achievements."
 SOV_socialist_emulation:0 "Socialist Emulation"
 SOV_socialist_emulation_desc:0 "Under the capitalist system, workers must compete with one another in order to win their daily bread, while the factory owners profit from any improvements the workers make that leads to increased productivity. This is wasteful and inhumane. A socialist system will allow those who are not yet the best the support they need to develop their abilities by learning from those who excell."
 SOV_socialist_realism:0 "Socialist Realism"
 SOV_socialist_realism_desc:1 "The road towards a bright Socialist future is long and often windy. Some people might even lose hope in that this goal can ever be achieved. We must show them exactly what they are working towards, by promoting an art style that shows what life in a socialist country would actually be like."
 SOV_the_komsomol:0 "The Komsomol"
 SOV_the_komsomol_desc:0 "We are not building Socialism for the adults of today, we are building it for the children and the generations not yet born. They must be taught how to improve and build on the achievements we will make, so that they can complete the work that we have started. We should form a special youth organisation that not only educates them but that also teaches them how to be good, communist members of society."
 SOV_patriarch_of_all_russia:0 "Patriarch of All Russia"
 SOV_patriarch_of_all_russia_desc:0 "While there is little reason for backwards superstition in an enlightened, Communist society, we must also acknowledge that many people have found strength and comfort in their faith during difficult times. Building a new kind of society is not short on difficulties, and so perhaps we should allow these religious institutions to continue to function, so long as they remain loyal to the state."
 SOV_the_comintern:0 "The Comintern"
 SOV_the_comintern_desc:0 "The struggle for the worker's liberation is not limited to any country; it is a global struggle. We must extend aid to comrades in any of the nations of the world, and fight the forces of reaction and counter-revolution wherever they may be found."
 SOV_development_aid_for_eastern_allies:0 "Development Aid For Eastern Allies"
 SOV_development_aid_for_eastern_allies_desc:0 "For centuries, western Imperialism and Colonialism have brutally exploited the countries in Asia. A modest investment from us would enable our allies in Asia to resist further capitalist encroachment that much more effectively."

 SOV_war_measures_in_the_east_desc:0 "The global struggle against fascism and other counter-revolutionary ideologies will certainly reach Asia before too long. We must make it clear to our allies that in desperate times, desperate measures might be needed."
 SOV_fortify_mongolian_border:0 "Fortify Mongolian Border"
 SOV_fortify_mongolian_border_desc:0 "While the Japanese hardliners have their eyes on China at the moment, we can not rule out that they might wish to expand their gains by attacking us. We should ensure that our Mongolian Allies don't turn into an open flank."
 SOV_send_military_advisors_to_spain:0 "Send Military Advisors To Spain"
 SOV_send_military_advisors_to_spain_desc:0 "Our comrades in Spain, after winning a democratic election, now face a reactionary counter-revolution. We must support them lest their defeat encourages fascists in other countries."
 SOV_policy_of_collective_security:0 "Policy of Collective Security"
 SOV_policy_of_collective_security_desc:0 "While they are capitalist and often reactionary, the democratic governments across Europe know that the fascists consider them weak and degenerate. If war comes, they would be the first to fall before the full fury of fascism is turned against the home of the revolution. Those politicians far-sighted enough to recognize this should know that they will find a sympathetic ear in Moscow."
 SOV_anti_fascist_policies:0 "Anti-Fascist Policies"
 SOV_anti_fascist_policies_desc:0 "There can be no peaceful co-existence with the fascists. We should reach out to any allies we can find and prepare for the inevitable confrontation."

 SOV_seek_a_defense_pact_with_the_allies_desc:0 "While there have been informal contacts with the western democracies, little concrete and legally binding has been agreed upon. It is time to put ink on paper and declare to the world that the western democracies are willing to form a Combined Front with us against fascist expansion."
 SOV_the_khakimov_proposal:0 "The Khakimov Proposal"
 SOV_the_khakimov_proposal_desc:0 "Comrade Khakimov has worked tirelessly to improve our standing with the government of [SAU.GetNameDef]. Some experts speculate that the region is home to a great amount of natural resources, which the capitalists are no doubt eager to exploit. We should continue to build a relationship of mutual trust in order to keep [SAU.GetNameDef] out of any hostile bloc and allow us first rights on any resources discovered."
 SOV_eradicate_western_fascism:0 "Eradicate Western Fascism"
 SOV_eradicate_western_fascism_desc:0 "We can not wait until the fascist regimes in western Europe deign to attack us at the moment of their choosing. The best way to deal with fascists is to hit first, and to hit hard."
 SOV_policy_of_individual_security:0 "Policy of Individual Security"
 SOV_policy_of_individual_security_desc:0 "We have few friends in the world, and a lot of enemies. We should not be overly concerned with who we make deals with - either they or us will break those deals anyway, once they have served their purpose."
 SOV_approach_germany:0 "Approach Germany"
 SOV_approach_germany_desc:0 "There is no reason why we shouldn't be able to come to accomodation with Germany. We won't be able to peacefully coexist with them forever, of course, but the Germans won't attack us while the western Allies still exist in their back - and we should encourage the Germans to deal with them first."
 SOV_liberation_of_the_european_proletariat:0 "Liberation of the European Proletariat"
 SOV_liberation_of_the_european_proletariat_desc:0 "The spineless bourgeois governments in western Europe have shown utterly unwilling to stand up to fascism. In the great struggle between fascism and communism that is to come, they won't play a role. The workers in those countries, however, are willing to fight with us against the scourge of fascism. We just have to give them governments that are willing to fight."
 SOV_anti_capitalist_policies:0 "Anti-Capitalist Policies"
 SOV_anti_capitalist_policies_desc:0 "It is evident that most, if not all, capitalist countries are perfectly content with merely pointing the fascists in another direction when they plan their expansion. When given the choice, the Bourgeois will always, ultimately, choose to oppress the proletariat. As such we can not trust them and we need to be prepared to take the fight to them."
 SOV_recover_alaska:0 "Recover Alaska"
 SOV_recover_alaska_desc:0 "The sale of Alaska to the Americans was a betrayal of the Russian people by their leadership. It is well past time that this betrayal is reversed, and the land recovered. The population would be much happier as part of our union than being part of the exploitative system that they currently live under."
 SOV_the_fight_for_the_pacific:0 "The Fight For the Pacific"
 SOV_the_fight_for_the_pacific_desc:0 "No matter our strength on land, we will have to cross water to get to grips with our enemies in the Pacific region. We must therefore develop our coastal infrastructure and ship-building industry before we can wage effective war in that area of the world."
 SOV_baltic_security:0 "Baltic Security"

 SOV_respect_baltic_self_determination:0 "Respect Baltic Self-Determination"
 SOV_respect_baltic_self_determination_desc:0 "Every people should be allowed to decide their own affairs in a democratic way.

We will ensure that the workers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have fair representation in their governments."
 SOV_claims_in_baltic:0 "Claims in Baltic"
 SOV_claims_in_baltic_desc:0 "The Baltic States were once an indivisible part of Russia. Their people need the protection of a large state that can defend them from exploitation. If the Baltic States don't agree to these terms, we might have to resort to force to ensure our protection."
 SOV_secure_leningrad:0 "Secure [195.GetName]"
 SOV_secure_leningrad_desc:1 "Our current border with Finland is far too close to [195.GetName] for comfort. A surprise attack from Finland could reach the city in a few hours. The location also makes it very easy to blockade our Baltic Fleet. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and we must make this clear to the Finnish government."
 SOV_control_scandinavia:0 "Control Scandinavia"
 SOV_control_scandinavia_desc:0 "The last remaining threat to our northern border are the governments on the Scandinavian peninsula. We must impress on them the fact that peaceful coexistence requires mutual trust, and we can not trust a government whose ideology does not align with ours."
 SOV_claims_on_poland:0 "Claims on Poland"
 SOV_claims_on_poland_desc:1 "Poland holds territories that have been Russian for centuries, splitting Ukraine and Belarus between our nations. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. They may have bested us in 1921, but we should remind them that times have changed."
 SOV_demand_eastern_poland:0 "Demand Eastern Poland"
 SOV_demand_eastern_poland_desc:1 "At the end of the great war, the Curzon line was established and agreed upon as Poland's eastern border. That line runs some 200 kilometers west of Polands current border. We should remind them of this basic historical fact and ensure that the border is where it should be."
 SOV_offer_poland_protection:0 "Offer Poland Protection"
 SOV_offer_poland_protection_desc:1 "Poland and the Polish people have suffered many deprivations and humiliations over the centuries. It is an open secret that the Germans want the territories given to Poland after the Great War back, and are willing to use violence to get them. We should offer the Polish government our protection, so long as they are willing to discuss the issue of our shared border."
 SOV_claim_on_bessarabia:0 "Claim on Bessarabia"
 SOV_claim_on_bessarabia_desc:0 "In 1918, the Romanians shamelessly capitalized on our internal troubles and annexed Bessarabia. It is time to remind them that they hold land that legally belongs to us, and if they are unwilling to restore the correct borders, we will force them out through military means."
 SOV_demand_balkan_submission:0 "Demand Balkan Submission"
 SOV_demand_balkan_submission_desc:0 "Past experiences have shown that the countries around us will exploit any weakness that we show. With war brewing in Europe, we can ill afford to have neighbours with questionable allegiences. The countries in the Balkans and in Asia minor will have to choose whether they want to stand with us or against us."
 SOV_seek_balkan_cooperation:0 "Seek Balkan Cooperation"
 SOV_seek_balkan_cooperation_desc:0 "The countries of Balkan peninsula and in Asia minor can make powerful allies, if we can get them to align their ideological views more closely with our own."

 SOV_support_afghan_ideology:0 "Support Afghan [GetIdeologyNameWithCaps]"
 SOV_support_afghan_ideology_desc:0 "Afghanistan is where proud nations are humbled. A military operation in the country would be costly at best and might not even succeed. We have a few contacts in Afghanistan who wish to establish a government that is ideologically closer aligned to us. We should support this endeavour."
 SOV_preemptive_invasion_of_iran:0 "Preemptive Invasion of Iran"
 SOV_preemptive_invasion_of_iran_desc:0 "The government of [PER.GetNameDef] can not be trusted to support us should war come, nor can we fully trust them not to enter a war against us. Rather than wait and see, we should force the issue and clear up the situation."
 SOV_the_threat_from_the_land_of_the_rising_sun:0 "The Threat from the Land of the Rising Sun"
 SOV_the_threat_from_the_land_of_the_rising_sun_desc:0 "It is clear that Japan wishes to dominate China. Once they have accomplished this, they will no doubt turn north to take the vast resources in Siberia. As long as they are busy in China, they will prefer not to move against us, and so we should ensure that the war in China last until we are ready to contest the Japanese."
 SOV_the_gobi_gambit:0 "The Gobi Gambit"

 SOV_two_red_flags:0 "Two Red Flags"
 SOV_two_red_flags_desc:0 "While the revolution has not quite succeeded in China, this is not unexpected.

Still, the communist party represents the best chance for the Chinese people to achieve a communist future."
 SOV_support_the_kuomintang:0 "Support the Kuomintang"
 SOV_support_the_kuomintang_desc:0 "The Chinese communists are militarily weak and have no industrial base from which to build a bigger army.

 SOV_end_the_khalkhin_gol_conflict_desc:0 "The border conflict with Japan has gone on long enough. If we can't trust a Japanese government to respect a recognized border, then we will have to replace that government."
 SOV_recover_the_kuril_islands:0 "Recover the Kuril Islands"
 SOV_recover_the_kuril_islands_desc:0 "The Kuril islands were lost after the disaster of 1905. If we strike fast and hard, we can recover them and present Japan with a situation where escalating the conflict is not worth it for them."

 SOV_spheres_of_influence_in_china:0 "Spheres of Influence In China"
 SOV_spheres_of_influence_in_china_desc:0 "The last remaining point of contention between us is the situation in China. Our own interests in the region are limited, and if we can buy Japanese support with an agreement about spheres of interest, then we should do so without hesitation."

 SOV_soviet_japanese_pact_against_usa_focus_desc:0 "The Japanese will want further expansion to fuel their growing economy.
