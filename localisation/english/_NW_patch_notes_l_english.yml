How the sons wish to resemble their fathers!.. But who needs them, the slaves of those peoples who were hostile to them, whom they fought all their lives? Now clouds are gathering over the world, and everyone silently reads a prayer, a curse upon the kafirs, sharpening their swords to rise again and gain freedom, to reclaim the greatness and glory for which their ancestors were known.\n\nThe Christian world is clouded over, and the East silently awaits the dawn.

Riddled with wars and petty tribal conflicts, the Arabs did not notice how they had become mere pawns in the rivalry between the great empires. But bedouins and townspeople still remember the time when all Muslims were united under the rule of the Caliph. All over the Arabian Peninsula there are increasingly loud calls for Muslims to be united under one banner. But will the Arabs be able to put aside clan conflicts and turn their militancy and religious fanaticism against foreign invaders, or will the colonizers continue to skilfully use the Arabian Peninsula's fragmentation to maintain their influence, without even bothering to maintain any large garrisons? That is entirely up to you.\n\nThis update includes new content for £GFX_SAU_flag_texticon §YSaudi Arabia§!, £GFX_YEM_flag_texticon §YYemen§!, £GFX_OMA_flag_texticon §YSultanate of Muscat§!, £GFX_IOM_flag_texticon §YImamate of Oman§!, £GFX_CYP_flag_texticon §YCyprus§!, small focus trees for the Sultanates of £GFX_QUA_flag_texticon §YQu'aiti§!, £GFX_KTH_flag_texticon §YKathiri§!, £GFX_MHR_flag_texticon §YQishn and Socotra§! and integrated content for £GFX_ITA_flag_texticon §YItaly§!."

It was only with the establishment of another dictatorship and the appointment of a skilled economist as prime minister that fragile stability was achieved in the country. However, this does not mean that the Estado Novo is now free from danger. The Communists have resurfaced under the banner of Comintern, aiming to unite dissatisfied factions into a united front.
