 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Japanese Empire is gradually recovering from the economic crisis, plunging into a political crisis. Army and navy officers commit terrorist attacks and assassinations of civilian politicians, then unauthorized incidents in China, which destabilizes the situation in foreign and domestic politics. And all this is happening against the background of two thoughts that have gripped the minds of all Japanese, all Japanese political leaders, from Democrats to supporters of the military shogunate - the modernization of the country and dissatisfaction with Japan's position in a world controlled by the West, namely the British Empire and the United States."
 
 NIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Nicaragua is going through a severe crisis. After a hard struggle against the US occupation, the liberation leader was assassinated by the commander of the regular army, despite the guarantees of the president. This gave rise to dual power. On the one hand, President Sakasa, representing the civil government. On the other hand, the director of the National Guard, who heads the military.\nObviously, this cannot last long, and someone has to take full power. However, even they should not forget about the remaining rebel army that fought against the United States, and the workers who raised their heads."

 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Great War put an end to the existence of the giant Ottoman Empire, which dominates in the Middle East, but Turkey itself avoided being torn apart between the Entente countries - Mustafa Kemal made a national revolution and built a republic on the ruins of a monarchical state.\n\nNow the state is stable and it's time to evaluate it the situation and decide with whom to go further - with the former enemies in the face of Britain or with the aggressive German Reich of Hitler."

 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Dozens of governments have changed in Portugal in a few years, and such a disaster could have lasted for many more years if Antonio Salazar had not become Prime Minister.\n\nAutocrat established the economic situation in the country and announced the creation of a “Estado Novo”, but who knows how long it can last."
 POR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The government of Salazar successfully showed itself in the Spanish Civil War and suppressed all sorts of speeches of left radicals.\n\nThe current task of the National Union is to determine the country's foreign policy orientation, because the wrong choice will threaten the very existence of Portugal..."

 COG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "A few decades ago, Congo was the personal property of the monarch of Belgium, but now it is directly ruled from Brussels.\n\nWith the new order, the economic condition of the territory can be improved, but this can be hindered by disgruntled Negroes united by the Church of Simon Kimbangu..."

 BRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "A former German colony that passed over as a result of the Great War, Rwanda-Urundi is a mandate of group "B" under the control of the Kingdom of Belgium. The backward kingdoms are only under the indirect control of the mandate holder, and the Mwami, Abami and chieftains, mainly of Tutsi nationality, still make up the administrative apparatus. The economy is dominated by the "client economy", concluded on the contract of the farmer, mainly Hutu with the monarch. Traditional forms in the developing world give rise to new social and national conflicts, and endless illnesses, court intrigues and Christianization among the natives are a heavy burden for the governor. Will he be able to cope?"
 
 LIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "For many years now, the true Whig party has dominated the country, keeping other groups out of power.\nThe Approaching world war will give us new opportunities, depending on which side we take, the Allies or the Axis?

 HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After the First World War, the Netherlands chose neutrality under pressure from pacifist sentiments. But many wondered whether this status would save them from invasion. The situation was made worse by the effects of the Great Depression, which caused a huge increase in unemployment, against which left-wing movements reared their heads.

 AUSTRIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As a result of the Great War, Austria-Hungary collapsed, and only the homely Austrian republic remained from the once great empire. The new Austrians wanted to become part of Germany, but the Entente did not make their dreams come true. \n\nNow when Austria is independent, Adolf Hitler himself healed to annex his former homeland, and because of the Ethiopian war, Austria lost an ally - Italy.

 AFG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Afghan people have gone through many events in recent years: independence, Amanullah's radical reforms and civil war. But its way of life has remained unchanged: a multitude of nomadic tribes, which are united only by a common faith, do not obey the authorities.\n In 1933 was killed Nadir Shah, who set a course for slow modernization and centralization. His son, Zahir, who was not ready to rule the Afghan state, ascended the throne. All power was concentrated in the hands of his uncle - Hashim Khan, who continues the course of his father, which does not like many tribes and maintaining stability will be a real challenge"

 SRL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After the new reforms, a political truce was formed in the political arena of Ceylon, against the background of the growing left-wing views among the workers who were dissatisfied with the power of the white planters.\nIn this troubled period, much depends on which side the views of the people will fall on.

On the side of the Congress, which seeks independence, despite the risk of remaining at the broken trough or go under the heel of the gaining strength of Japan?\nBut who said that the British authorities would allow it?"

 NFL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The tiny island nation flourished in the post-war years. However, the Great depression that began in 1929 turned into an economic collapse for the dominion of Newfoundland. The dependence on salted fish exports, coupled with huge debts, led to a crisis so deep that in 1934 the country was forced to cancel its self-government and become a colony again, remaining a dominion in name only. Nevertheless, the people have the right to call for a referendum that will decide the future of Newfoundland. Will it become a dominion again? Or maybe the people would like to be reunited with Canada? Or maybe Pro American sentiment will prevail on the island."

 YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After getting independence from the dissolved Ottoman Empire, all power in Yemen got to the hands of the leader of the Shia sect of zaydites, Imam Yahya.

 BPL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "After the end of the great war, Britain received a League of Nations mandate to govern Palestine, a troubled Jewish - Arab region. Initially, London declared its desire to create a Jewish state on its mandated territory, but now it is retreating from these positions.\nThe tension in the country is growing and if you do not take steps to resolve the situation, then Palestine will explode, engulfing the entire Middle East."
 BPL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The Arab revolt in mandatory Palestine ended in defeat, and yet the most difficult years for the Holy Land are ahead - the Nazi threat is becoming more and more obvious, and if German troops enter Palestine, it is worth waiting for a disaster."
 
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Iraq was a subject territory of the British Empire after the great war, but it defended its independence while maintaining British influence inside.

 BMD_SCENARIO_DESC: "Bermuda is 150 small Islands located in the center of the Atlantic ocean and forgotten by everyone except the locals. However, despite this characteristic, it is Bermuda that is the main base of the Royal Navy in the Western Atlantic, without which it is impossible to communicate the United Kingdom with the colonies in America. The Bermuda flag has already flown in the sky over Europe in the great war, so it is foolish to expect that a new war in Europe will do without these proud little people."
 
 EGY_SCENARIO_DESC: "For several years now, Egypt has been rid of the humiliating British protectorate, but this has not yet secured the country's independence. The British armed forces still have military bases throughout the country, in fact, control the Sudan, and the king's health leaves much to be desired. It is obvious that the king will not last long, and further policy will depend on his young heir once he is crowned. Will it make mistakes, will it bend under the British colonial machine, or will it be able to choose a decent government that will be able to defend the country in these difficult years?"
 
 NEP_SCENARIO_DESC: "Having overthrown the Shah dynasty, the Rana did not eliminate the Royal dynasty, leaving it a figurehead of «power». The victors of the court intrigues themselves concentrated power on the post of Prime Minister, who had full power. Fearing foreign intervention, the country remained closed for many years, leaving only the British representation after the defeat of the British. Being isolated, the country is noticeably behind the rest of the world, but ties with the UK and the course of the new Minister will correct this shortcoming in the shortest possible time. But will the oppositionists calmly await their fate at this time, whether in favor of the people or the king?"
 
 BHU_SCENARIO_DESC: "For 200 years Bhutan was actually in a state of continuous civil war, and only at the beginning of the twentieth century Ugyen Wangchuck was able to reunite and strengthen the country, founding a new dynasty. In 1910 he signed the Treaty of Punakha with Britain, under which the latter guaranteed independence and non-interference in the internal affairs of Bhutan, but took control over the foreign policy of the kingdom.\nNow Bhutan is ruled by Jigme Wangchuck, continuing the policy of his father to centralize and modernize the state. Can he make Bhutan prosperous or will the country remain a backward mountain kingdom?"
 
 SKM_SCENARIO_DESC: "During its history, Sikkim has been under Tibetan, Nepalese, and Bhutanese rule. Now it is a small Himalayan Kingdom is a protectorate of Great Britain. The interests of the British in the country are limited to trade with Tibet through its territory, which is why the local feudal lords retained their power and even strengthened it. The conservative nobility strongly hinders the development of the country, but the people will not forever tolerate cruel feudal exploitation..."
 
 TIB_SCENARIO_DESC: "Tibet was once a great empire whose collapse gave rise to a unique culture and Buddhism. With the decline of the empire, Tibet fell under the Chinese sphere of influence, and only British support saved it from becoming another puppet of the Kuomintang. The death of the XIII Dalai Lama was followed by a political crisis, at the end of which a regent was identified, and it would seem that nothing could threaten the country's peace, except that a party adhering to the positions of the Kuomintang began to gain strength in the country. The few leftist supporters are pushing for an uprising in Xikang, and the regent is far from as clean as he should be for raising a new Dalai Lama."

 ALB_SCENARIO_DESC: "Having survived the Ottoman rule, several coups took place in Albania, at the end of which Prime Minister Zogu took over and declared himself the new king of the Albanian kingdom.\n\nHowever, even these changes did not remedy the plight of the country, which forced the country to seek help from Italy, and drove Albania into huge debts and hung a lot of responsibilities. The choice will decide the future policy, will we follow the course of Italy, or will we go our own way?"
 
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Denmark was not directly involved in the Great War, but even then it had to choose between Britain and Germany, the country's two main trading partners. Choosing one side would have meant severing ties with the other, but fortunately the country managed to maintain its shaky neutrality.\n\nNow, with the economy weakened by high unemployment and Christian X's credibility undermined by his authoritarian aspirations, the Scandinavian kingdom once again has to choose which side to take, and there is no doubt that this time the Danish people will have to take up arms."
 DEN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC_DESC: "The threat of World War comes from Germany, the Danish kingdom's closest neighbor. Scandinavian kingdom will have to make every effort to preserve its independence - there is no doubt that the Wehrmacht, seeking to gain control of the Baltic Sea, will try to occupy Jutland and the Denmark islands..."

 SAU_SCENARIO_DESC: "At the beginning of the XX century, it seemed that the once-powerful Al Saud clan was finally defeated and ruined. However, in 1902, the energetic Prince Abdulaziz, with a force of only 40 men, succeeded in capturing Riyadh in a daring raid. Enlisting the support of the Ikhwan, the militant settled Bedouins who adhere to Wahhabism, the young king waged wars to unify Arabia for 30 years. Having completed his conquests and suppressed the rebellions of the Ikhwan, who wanted the continuation of jihad and were hostile to all innovations, Abdulaziz began the process of gradual reform of the state..."

 IOM_SCENARIO_DESC: "The Imamate of Oman was proclaimed in 1913 as a result of an uprising in the Sultanate of Muscat by conservative Ibadi Muslims who were dissatisfied with the strengthening of British influence in the country. In 1918, with the mediation of the United Kingdom, the Sultanate and the Imamate concluded the Treaty of Seeb, which effectively sealed the division of the country into two parts.\nWhile Muscat was mired in tribal strife, the Imamate had a chance to unite the country under its banner. But we must act quickly, before Muscat gains strength. In addition, it will probably have to make some concessions to the British, so as not to incur their wrath."
 
 OMA_SCENARIO_DESC: "The Sultanate of Muscat once extended its influence from the southern coast of Persia to Zanzibar and Madagascar. But in the twentieth century, the once great trading empire turned into yet another British protectorate, retaining only the Indian city of Gwadar among all its overseas possessions. In addition, the uprising of Muslims in 1913 led to the proclamation of a de facto independent Imamate of Oman in the interior of the country.\nAt the moment, Muscat is still riven by tribal strife, and some sheikhs dream of overthrowing the Sultan. There is still a chance of a second war with Oman. Perhaps we should attack first, taking advantage of British support."
 
 TAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Tuvan statehood was born in the last years of the Russian Civil War. Tuva was not recognized by almost any of the world's states, its language and culture emerged before the eyes of its contemporaries. Collectivization arranged by local communists finally ruined the poor country.\n For all that, Tuva is bound to the USSR by treaty and economic aid, while its other neighbor, Mongolia, looks longingly at its once former territory."

 ICE_SCENARIO_DESC: "The signing of the Act of Union with Denmark in 1918, giving Iceland complete freedom in domestic politics and keeping only defense and foreign policy under Danish control, was another step on the island's path to independence.\n\nDenmark was generally willing to grant Iceland independence, but could the island maintain its freedom during the years of great power confrontation? Will Icelandic democracy be able to withstand the rise of right-wing and left-wing radicalism?"
