In the end, he concluded, "There is no one but Konoe." Prince Konoe declined the offer of the premiership, but his nomination marked a recognition by Saionji and others that court nobles such as Konoe, Kido, and Harada, who transcended party affiliation, represented the best prospect for easing tensions within and between elite groups. Disappointed in his first choice, Saionji recommended career diplomat Hirota Koki."

Firstly, he was from Kansai and reflected the hostile attitude of the Osaka business world towards the controlled economy. Secondly, he worries about working with Vice Minister Shinji Yoshino, who has been in office for five years and who may try to sideline him. Thirdly, as the leader of the Minseitō, he did not like Yoshino's predilection for Rikken Seiyūkai or Kishi's connections with political and industrial figures in Choshu (for example, with Yōsuke Matsuoka, president of the South Manchurian Railway). Finally, Ogawa obviously did not trust either Yoshino or Kishi, but especially Kishi because of his participation in the protests against wage cuts a few years earlier."

Это было расценено как оскорбление величества. Минобэ был назначен в Палату пэров в 1932 году, но был вынужден уйти в отставку после покушения и резкой критики в его нелояльности к императору.

 JAP_Seva: "Shōwa"
 JAP_Seva_desc: "According to tradition, each emperor proclaims his own era upon ascension to the throne, to which he himself chooses a name. Hirohito, during his enthronement ceremony on 25 December 1926, gave it the name Shōwa. This term can be roughly understood as "enlightened world" or, in some interpretations, "shining Japan". In his address to the nation, the Emperor described why he chose this name: "I have visited the battlefields of the Great War in France. In the presence of such devastation, I realised the blessing of peace and the need for harmony among nations." However, in the political and military environment, many associate the name of the new era with the radical changes that are to take place in Japan, comparable to the Meiji Revolution, which clearly contradicts the emperor's words..."
 JAP_Reiva: "Reiwa"
 JAP_Heysei: "Heisei"
 JAP_army_factionalism: "Army Factionalism"
 JAP_army_factionalism_desc: "The new era brought new trends to the military environment - officers of various stripes became more and more interested in politics, more and more competitive with each other and, most importantly, with the civilian government. When economical stagnation began, it radicalised their actions, leading to a series of coup attempts to implement their own reforms, but on the other hand, it divided the military and forced them to fight with each other, which also resulted in a series of terrorist attacks and examples of extremism among them."
 JAP_zaibatsus: "Zaibatsu"

Although they helped Japan undergo modernisation during the Meiji Restoration, these days their existence is frowned upon by many common people and elites due to the economic turmoil of recent years. They are being replaced by the "new Zaibatsu," which are already much more aimed to modern trends, but the "old" ones still continue to play an important role economically and sometimes politically."

 JAP_gekokujo_desc: "A Japanese word for someone in a lower position overthrowing someone in a higher position, using military or political might, seizing power. It is variously translated as "the lower rules the higher" or "the low overcomes the high." In recent years, militaries at all levels have become active in the practice of gekokujō, such as assassination attempts on politicians or foreigners, attempted coups d'etat, and sometimes even in the unauthorised seizure of Manchurian territory in China. Failure to put an end to this military freedom could have irreparable damage to the country.§!\n\n§9An excessive level of insubordination in the military would lead to their attempts to act independently in China and Asia, and will also allow them to influence the civilian government in Tokyo by intimidation and exploiting legal loopholes in the Meiji Constitution.§!\n\n\n§R To remove $JAP_gekokujo$, it is necessary to reduce the Insubordination Level to zero.§!"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society: "Kokuryūkai"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society_desc: "The secret organisation Kokuryūkai traces its history back to 1901, when it was founded by Japanese nationalist Ryōhei Uchida, originally to resist Russian influence in Asia. The name reflected its meaning - to drive the Russians beyond the Amur River, which in Chinese is called the Black Dragon River. After the organisation's spectacular successes during the Russo-Japanese War, high-ranking government officials, cabinet ministers and members of the state security agencies began to join the organisation. The organisation published a number of newspapers and magazines to promote its views. Kokuryūkai periodicals were published and distributed in China and Korea, and in English as well. "Amur Bulletin" received support, including financial support, from a number of Japanese corporations and large firms, as well as banks and trading houses. The Amur River Society organised a school for training in professional espionage, whose agents were engaged in intelligence on the actions of the Russian Empire and worked against it in Russia, Manchuria, Korea and China. With the direct assistance of Kokuryūkai, gangs of Chinese militarists (the most famous of whom was Zhang Zuolin) were created in north-eastern China to fight Russian and Soviet influence. Following the pan-Asian ideas it preached, the Kokuryūkai provided financial and other assistance to revolutionaries in East Asia, such as Sun Yat-sen in China and Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippines. The organisation was also in close contact with various Buddhist organisations and sects in Asian countries. In recent years, the Amur River Society's agent networks have enveloped almost the entire world, operating in Turkey, Morocco, Ethiopia, South-east Asia, South America, Europe and the United States, among others."

 NW_JAP_looser.0.t: "Totalitarianism is a Moral Bankrupt"
 NW_JAP_looser.0.d: "The totalitarian idea that has captured the minds of most politicians of our country in recent years in the course of the real test - total war. And though it sounds paradoxical, this test proved that totalitarianism could not cope with such a total war. Now it is time for it to leave the political scene and give way to other ideologies. To do this, the first thing we need to do is to amend the Meiji constitution to ensure that such experiments are not repeated."
 NW_JAP_looser.0.a: "Democracy Rises from Oblivion!"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.t: "Reneissance of Parliamentary Parties"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.d: "The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has become a vivid testimony to the unsustainability of the idea of a one-party state - now it is time to destroy it in order to continue on the path of democratisation of Japan. Since the original members of the Association were almost all members of the old parliamentary parties, they are now going to recreate them, but under new names. Thus, Rikken Seiyūkai will now be called the Conservative Party, Rikken Minseitō - the Progressive Party, and Shakai Taishuto - the Social Democratic Party. Nakano's supporters, on the other hand, took the name Toho Jikai."
 NW_JAP_looser.1.a: "The Experiment is Obviously a Failure"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.t: "Victory of Rikken Minseitō"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again"- such a sarcastic comment was received on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Rikken Minseitō party won the election, as it had won several previous elections in a row. However, political elites were reluctant to trust its leader to run the country - and perhaps that is what brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.2.a: "Well this time it looks like the party has a chance to form a cabinet..."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.t: "Victory of the Progressive Party"
 NW_JAP_looser.3.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again" - such a sarcastic comment was Victory of Rikken Minseitōreceived on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Progressive Party, which is made up of members of the former Rikken Minseitō, which has won a majority in the last few elections, won this election as well. However, political elites were reluctant to entrust its leader with running the country - and it is possible that this is what has brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.a: "But now, in a modified form, the party has a chance to form a cabinet!"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.t: "Tanzan Ishibashi"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.d: "Despite all the repression and arrests of many scholars, there remained one unbreakable bastion of free speech: the journals Oriental Economic Review and the English-language Oriental Economist. Their editor-in-chief was Tanzan Ishibashi, a philosophy graduate of Waseda University who began writing for the journals in the late 1910s, commenting on the Japanese government's financial policies.\n\nDuring his years as editor, Ishibashi's scathing, liberal commentary on almost every significant event was the subject of almost every editorial. Although Ishibashi was widely known as a liberal, government officials highly valued his economic expertise and constantly called upon him as an independent expert and advisor to the government on economic issues.\n\nUntil the last moment, he resisted the ideology of militarism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Instead, he advocated a "Little Japan" policy that favoured abandoning Manchuria and Japanese colonies in order to refocus efforts on Japan's own economic and cultural development. Despite these ultra-liberal values, his expert ability allowed him to continue to speak his mind even in the harshest of times.\n\nRikken MinseitōNow, after his words about the need to abandon colonies and the dangers of military influence on politics and expansion into China were confirmed in their truest sense, Tanzan decided to step out of journalism and expert judgement and into politics. To do so, he agreed to join and lead Rikken Minseitō, as its positions are the closest to Tanzan's own."
 NW_JAP_looser.4.a: "Welcome back, Ishibashi-san!"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.t: "Minor Japanism"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.d: "Tanzan Ishibashi was the editor-in-chief of the journals  became an opportunity during the years of repression for many other journalists, academics and analysts to express their thoughts without fear of being arrested by the security services for doing so. This was done thanks to the fact that their articles remained anonymous. Ishibashi's own moral and expert authority allowed him to publish all this and not get his journals banned."
 NW_JAP_looser.5.a: "The state should always have a stop valve, Ishibashi is it."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.t: "Mass Pardon"
 NW_JAP_looser.6.d: "Today the Emperor, on the advice of the Prime Minister, issued a decree pardoning many political prisoners, including scientists, cultural figures and even some radical politicians. There was no cancellation of the Peace Preservation Law, but now this 'gesture on the part of the emperor' will make the security services think twice when they want to arrest some other 'unreliable person'.."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.a: "Truly the prime minister we deserve..."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.t: "Resumption of the Activities of Kingorō Hashimoto"
 NW_JAP_looser.7.d: "The relentless Colonel Hashimoto, who had been disturbing the constitutional order of the state since the early 30s, has resumed his activities again - his organisation, practically a personal army, is beginning to swell dramatically with a large number of new supporters from among the demobilised military who cannot find themselves in civilian life. If we don't try to turn the situation around, with the low stability and high popularity of his ideas, he will succeed in overthrowing the current government and installing one that will not take such radical action against the army."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.a: "We'll keep an eye on it."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.t: "Mass Rallies in the Streets"
 NW_JAP_looser.8.d: "Today, discontent with the government has taken to the streets as many politicians feared. The main problem is that these are now ex-military men who can handle weapons and are willing to take risks. They are the ones Hashimoto is betting on - the tension, instability, and clashes on the streets have been there for a long time, but now it has erupted into a mass protest demanding the resignation of the government."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.a: "We have to try to suppress them!"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.t: "Hashimoto's Coup"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.d: "The government's attempted suppression of mass rallies throughout the capital led to more riots and the eventual storming of the parliament building and other government offices. The protesters were led by Hashimoto's men, who demanded the formation of a government led by Shūmei Ōkawa, a close friend of Kingorō since before the war." 
 NW_JAP_looser.9.a: "There's nothing left to do but agree to his demands."
 NW_JAP_looser.10.t: "Konoe and his Friends"
 NW_JAP_looser.10.d: "Unexpectedly for many, Konoe behaved graciously towards many of those convicted in political cases in the 1930s: as military conspirators, ultra-nationalist politicians and even communists (convicted under the Peace Protection Act) - most of whom have been granted amnesty today. This is hardly indicative of a move towards the abolition of the Peace Protection Act, as those who know Konoe well could have expected such an outcome - there was always room for a few communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers in his circle of close friends."

 NW_JAP_looser.11.t: "Wrong Prediction"
 NW_JAP_looser.11.d: "For a long time, in all the texts that Ishiwara wrote and his supporters replicated, the 'Final' or 'Last' War was seen as inevitable. In a sense, the 'Final War' was supposed to be a religious war leading to the inevitable victory of Nichiren Buddhism, the desired end result. However, Ishiwara, defending Japan's unrivalled freedom of religion, insisted that he would never use the force of the state or law to suppress Christianity or Pure Land Buddhism, believing that religion would be unified through persuasion and debate. While Ishiwara and his supporters described the last war as a prerequisite for the global spread of Nichiren Buddhism, they ultimately left extremely vague how this would happen in practice. After the heavy defeat in China, a growing number of East Asian League members questioned the extent to which this war was desirable or obligatory. Today, this most radical element of the ideology of Nichirenism has finally fallen - the East Asia League now recognises pacifism, and Ishiwara himself made a statement to journalists during which he said that he 'recognises' that his prediction of a final war between Asia and the West 'was a profound conceit and actually a mistake'."

The Japanese Government has fulfilled its purposes and does not wish to wage war with us any further.\n\nThey naturally assume that our part of our overseas colonies will be ceded to Japan or its collaborator governments as a result of the agreement."

 NW_JAP_looser.13.a: "Maybe then they'll agree."
 NW_JAP_looser.14.t: "Adoption of Esperanto"
 NW_JAP_looser.14.d: "The Empire of Japan has decided to adopt Esperanto as the new lingua franca for all members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This should strengthen the pan-Asian spirit of our countries, since not just the languages of different Asian countries differ greatly, but also the writing itself. Esperanto will thus become the universal language of communication among the nations of Asia. This gesture is very favourable on their part, as one would have expected a demand for the adoption of Japanese."

 NW_JAP.0.d: "It is impossible to deny at this moment the tremendous successes of the Bolshevik economic program and the first five-year plan. A real threat looms over Manchuria because of the increased numbers of armored troops, aviation, and artillery now available to the Red Army.\n\n\n\n/n Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, leader of the Manchurian Military Faction and initiator of the Manchurian Incident, gathered several key officers from the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff at the Takaretai Restaurant in Tokyo. It was he who, after the recent assassination of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzan, who was the leader of the Toseiha faction and the initiator of the project of industrialization and militarization of the Japanese economy, suddenly took his place - the main mover of the project of modernization of Japanese industry and the army.\n\n\n\n It can be said that after this meeting, even the most skeptical representatives of the generals and officers in general began to agree with the far-reaching conclusions of the two colonels - the living and the dead."
 NW_JAP.0.a: "This is despite the difference in other political views of all these people"
 NW_JAP.1.t: "Five-Year Plan for Japanese and Manchurian Industries"
 NW_JAP.1.d: "After the death by katana of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzana the previous fall, Ishiwara took the even more important step of systematically planning for future war. Among the unpleasant surprises he encountered when he joined the General Staff, his discovery was that there was no coordinated study of Japan's economic potential, either government or private. In addition, the army lacked the expertise to conduct such a survey. He took on such a task, which entailed processing a vast sea of statistical data into clear budgetary and administrative proposals and assuming responsibility for economic planning, and formed his own think tank, the Japan-Japan Association for Financial and Economic Research. He chose an old acquaintance from the Mantetsu Company - Miyazaki Masayoshi - to head the organization. Despite the fact that the Association was based in Japan, it received strong material support from Manchuria. Through the good offices of Itagaki Seishiro, who was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army at the end of 1935, Mantetsu President Yosuke Matsuoku was persuaded to allocate half of the Association's budget of two million yen from company funds. The other half was secretly supplied by the General Staff itself."
 NW_JAP.1.a: "And who is Miyazaki?"
 NW_JAP.2.t: "The Miyazaki Group"
 NW_JAP.2.d: "Mr. Miyazaki is an interesting figure. He was born in Ishikawa Prefecture and was sent as a student to study in Russia just before the Great War. In Moscow during the revolution, he became interested in Marxist theory and the contradictions of capitalism, though without any obvious political leanings in that direction. He returned to Japan to work at Mantetsu, but in the second half of the twenties was again in Moscow to study Soviet economic planning, the general direction and possibilities of which apparently interested him deeply. In the thirties, returning to Japan as head of the research department of the Mitsui Bank, he acquired a solid reputation as an analyst and planner. In doing so, however, he found himself little connected to a group of so-called "reformist bureaucrats" with similar political views to his own. Despite this, Ishiwara's brain trust ended up with just such a shortened name, the 'Miyazaki Group'."

 NW_JAP.3.t: "Opening of the National Parliament Building"
 NW_JAP.3.d: "For the first 50 years of its existence, the Sejm met in various temporary premises, because for a long time the government could not decide what form the building built especially for this purpose should take. The first projects appeared already in the 1880s, but they were designed by German architects, which caused rejection from the majority of the public, demanding to get rid of "international" architecture for such an important symbol of Japan. In 1898, the famous American architect Ralph Adams Cram proposed a more "oriental" design of the building with tiled roofs and a large wall and gate enclosure. However, this design was rejected after the fall of Ito Hirobumi, who was the main proponent of the plan. The next two temporary structures died under similar circumstances, in 1890 and 1925, from fires caused by poor electrical wiring. As early as 1910, the Ministry of Finance set up a commission in an attempt to take control of the new parliament building project, as the Ministry of the Interior was clearly not up to the task. Prime Minister Katsura Taro led the commission, which recommended that the new building should emulate the Italian Renaissance architectural style. This recommendation was criticized by many who felt the choice was too arbitrary.\n\n\nIn 1918, the ministry sponsored a public design competition, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, came up with a design where the building ended in a "pyramid," reflecting modern hybrid architecture than purely European or Asian designs. Construction began in 1920, but was monstrously delayed by the Kanto earthquake and financial crises."

Despite its name, it is believed to be primarily aimed at establishing totalitarian rule in the country and getting rid of parliamentary politics.

At least temporarily, he would retire. In doing so, the general advised the emperor to appoint a general from Ugaki's entourage as prime minister so as not to destroy the system of keeping the military out of power."

 NW_JAP.11.d: "Kanjū Katō, elected as a deputy from leftist workers' organizations in the 1936 election, suggested that Mosaburō Suzuki, founder of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, join forces. Both had long been known as fighters against the country's growing militarism. Previous attempts to create a mass left-wing party had failed - either they could not gain popularity or were thwarted by the government. Katō Kanjū was chosen as the head of the new party, as the party itself was claimed to be the "political wing of the labor movement" and Katō is the chairman of the left-wing trade union federation. Moreover, the party proclaims as one of its tasks "the establishment of a Popular Front for the struggle against fascism and war in Japan." The successful practice of such broad political coalitions of left-wing forces around the world seems to have reached Japan."

 NW_JAP.15.d: "This morning at a hotel in Tokyo's Oga district, the mutilated body of a man was found in one of the rooms - his genitals were missing. The police found out rather quickly that the murdered man was Kichizō Ishida, the 42-year-old owner of the Yoshidaya fish restaurant. In addition, the phrase "We, Sada and Kichi Ishida, are alone" was written in blood on his left thigh as well as on a sheet. Also, a hieroglyph meaning the name "Sada" was carved on his left hand.\n\nIt was reported from the hotel management that he was staying here with prostitute Sada Abe, who was the last person to see him until he left the hotel at 8am, telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.\n\nSuch circumstances led to the story being picked up by newspapers and journalists, which had already become national news - literally causing panic across the country as frantic people began searching for the murder suspect. Police have received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a crush in the Ginza neighborhood. In reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo - the February 26 incident, the crime was satirically named the "May 18 Incident.""

 NW_JAP.16.d: "The medical examination concluded that Ishida had been killed by strangulation, and that he had lost his genitals afterward. The search for the killer continued until the police arrived at a hotel in the Shinagawa district where a suspicious girl with a strange name was staying.\n\n- Don't be so formal, - she told them, - you're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well, that's me. I'm Sada Abe.\n\nHowever, the police were not convinced they had found their target, whereupon the girl showed Ishida's genitals as evidence. No further corroboration was needed. Abe was arrested and interrogated for eight sessions. When asked why she cut off Ishido's genitals, she said, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that gave me the most vivid memories." The officer conducting the interrogation was struck by Abe's behavior when asked why she killed Ishido. "Immediately she became agitated, and her eyes flashed strangely in some way." Her answer was as is: "I loved him so much, I wanted him to be all for me. But since we weren't husband and wife while he was alive, he could be held by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could touch him anymore, so I killed him....."

 NW_JAP.17.d: "By 5 a.m., crowds were already gathering outside the courthouse to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details surrounding the trial, but made sure that the proceedings were conducted with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before sentencing began, "What I regret most about this incident is that I have been misunderstood - as some kind of sexual pervert... I have never had a man in my life like Ishido who loved and slept with without taking money, but none of them made me feel the way I felt about him." Abe was convicted of murder and mutilation of a corpse. Although the prosecution demanded ten years and Abe claimed she wanted the death penalty, she was actually sentenced to only six years in prison.\n\nThe police report of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national bestseller this year. When details of the crime were made public, rumors spread that Ishido's penis was of extraordinary big size. However, the police officer who questioned the killer after his arrest denied this, saying, "Ishido's was just average. She told me: 'Size does not make a man in bed. The technique and his desire to give me pleasure was what I liked."\n\nThe person most affected by the story (not counting the murdered man) was Goro Omiya, Abe's first lover, a professor and banker who had hoped to become a member of the Seimas, but whose political career was naturally ruined after journalists published all the details of the story in the newspapers."

 NW_JAP.18.d: "Hachiko was born on November 10, 1923 in the Japanese prefecture of Akita. A farmer decided to give the puppy to Professor Hidesaburo Ueno, who worked at Tokyo Imperial University. The professor gave the puppy the name Hachiko - from the Japanese words "hachi" and "ko", the second meaning attachment or dependence, and the first because the dog was the professor's eighth dog.\n\nAs Hachiko grew older, he followed his owner everywhere he went. Professor would go to the city every day for work, so Hachiko would first walk him to the entrance of Shibuya Station and then return at 3 p.m. to meet his master. On May 21, 1925, a professor at the university had a stroke. Doctors could not save his life, and he never returned home. Hachiko was eighteen months old at the time. That day he never waited for his master, but he began to come to the station every day, patiently waiting for him until late in the evening. He spent the night on the porch of the professor's house.\n\nDespite attempts to place the dog in the homes of the professor's friends and relatives, he invariably kept returning to the station. Local shopkeepers and railroad workers fed Hachiko, admiring his persistence. The dog became famous throughout Japan in 1932 after an article published in one of the largest newspapers in Tokyo entitled "A loyal old dog awaits the return of his owner, who died seven years ago". The story won the hearts of the Japanese people, and curious people started coming to Shibuya Station to see the dog.\n\nApril 21, 1934 Hachiko was erected a monument, at the opening of which he personally attended. But exactly one year ago, the faithful dog died, he was found not far from the station - the autopsy showed that he had cancer in the last stage. It shocked people then. Today, on the first anniversary of his death, a large and diverse crowd gathered at Shibuya Station to honor his memory."

His most important role was when he himself was prime minister, but equally important was his work as a genrō, especially when he was the last remaining genrō after 1924, as he had to advise the emperor on the appointment of a new prime minister.\n\nThe last few years have proved that with the onset of old age (Kinmochi is over 85 years old) he is no longer able to cope with his role - political instability has reached a level that the country has probably never experienced before. Realizing this, the genrō decided to retire from all government posts, thus eliminating the very institution of the genrōrat and going to live a quiet life on his estate."

 NW_JAP.21.d: "Despite the fact that a full-scale war with the Republic of China has begun, many newspaper readers and people who follow politics closely wonder why Rikken Minseitō MP Saito Takao, a well-known critic of militarism, is silent. People write letters to him, who knows his address, and to newspapers and other deputies. To stem this flow of incomprehensible cries, an announcement was made in several metropolitan newspapers by Rikken Minseitō party members and close friends of Saito that he is now in recovery from a suspected stroke, since he unluckily stumbled and fell on the stairs a few months ago. However, he continues to keep a close eye on the situation in the world and the country as he prepares to return to his regular activities."

 NW_JAP.22.d: "The elderly Saito Takao once again went to the Seimas podium to make his speech. The head of the party, Machida Chūji, tried to prevent him from speaking when he learned of the content of the speech, but he could do nothing - party discipline was already too low. Another speech once again stretched on for long, shrill minutes.\n\nThe main points of the speech were as follows: the situation with the Chinese incident and ways out of it, does the current government understand exactly what is the best way to deal with it; secondly, what is the content of the so-called construction of a new order in East Asia; thirdly, in view of the history of wars in the world, can it be achieved world peace in addition to peace in the East; fourthly, a few questions about the Chinese governments in the territories controlled by our army; Fifth, a warning to the current Cabinet by discussing the government's responsibility for the start of the Chinese incident.\n\nThe room was quiet during the speech, with only a few cries from small and medium-sized groups, the rest of the room was quiet and there was occasional applause. "But there seemed to be a vague unease in the room," were the comments Saito made to reporters after the meeting. Saito recited almost his entire speech from memory - he had devoted several weeks to creating and memorizing it."

 NW_JAP.23.d: "After the speech, the Jikyoku Doshikai and Shakai Taishuto parties made a statement that Saito's speech offended the purpose of the Japanese Empire's movement in Asia. This was answered by Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader], The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, but Saito was not satisfied with their answers. In addition, the Minister of War did not respond, although this was what the MP was most looking forward to.\n\nThis is because the Army's position was divided. The Minister of War was on the side of those who really thought that the Chinese incident had gone on long enough. So he didn't answer anything officially, but after the meeting he personally told Saito, "I'm impressed. You're pretty good at what you say." But the head of the Political Affairs Department of the East Asian Development Council and the head of the Military Affairs Bureau, who listened to the speech as members of the government looked at each other with wry smiles and said quietly, "Saito would say something like that."\n\nIn addition, Matsutoshi Koyama, Speaker of the House of Representatives and member of the Rikken Minseitō, spoke, saying: "There is no one who knows the purpose of war in the spiritual movement." He also wrote it down and gave it to Misao Ōki, the chief secretary of the House of Representatives, and ordered him to secretly delete about two-thirds of the entire speech, or about 10,000 words, that were particularly critical of the military. Although Ōki resisted, he finally conceded to Koyama."

 NW_JAP.24.d: "When the attack on Saito began, the Minseito Party leadership hastily worked with the army to try to resolve the situation by removing the content of Saito's speech from the stenographic transcript. Saito visited Chairman Koyama with senior party members and his friends and said: "If the army is unhappy with the content of the speech, why didn't War Minister Shunroku Hata respond to it?".\n\nHowever, because of the delay in the removal procedure, some local newspapers published all of Saito's anti-war speeches the next day, and the anti-war speeches in the Japanese parliament became known all over the world. Right now, reports about it are being printed in Chinese and American newspapers.\n\nRikken Minseitō members, seeing that the military and others continued to attack Saito, tried to force Saito to "voluntarily resign," but he flatly refused, suggesting that they "accept it as inevitable." As a result, it was decided to send Saito Takao to a Disciplinary Committee headed by the Seimas Speaker."
 NW_JAP.24.a: "Let's see where this goes"
 NW_JAP.25.t: "Meeting of the Disciplinary Committee"
 NW_JAP.25.d: "Discussions have begun on Saito Takao's act within the parties as a vote is expected on his expulsion from the current House of Representatives caucus. The Nakajima Faction of the Rikken Seiyūkai Party, Jikyoku Dōshikai and Shakai Taishūtō have united in support of punishment, while the majority of the Kuhara Seiyūkai Faction appears to be against the punishment. The Minseitō Party is holding a secret meeting of representatives to discuss the issue, but the majority of the party is in opposition, and it doesn't look like this will be easily resolved due to the hot debate over the attacks on the leaders.\n\nIn his defense before the committee, Saito described the process that led to the question and speech and the general content of the speech, and then broke down the seven reasons for punishment presented by the Seiyūkai Nakajima faction, one by one, with counterarguments. In addition, the complainant was completely indignant and could not respond to a single word of the accused deputy.\n\nVoting followed, the results of which were distributed as follows. There were 167 empty seats in the Seimas, or less than a third of lawmakers decided not to attend. The Rikken Minseitō Party ended the party debate in favor of exclusion, but Kyujiro Okazaki, close to Saito, opposed exclusion and left the party. He was the only Democrat to vote against it. Of the remaining 170 members, 69, or more than 40%, were absent or abstained. In the Rikken Seiyūkai, 27 of the 71 members of the Kuhara faction abstained or were absent, and 5, the largest number of any faction, were opposed. 16 of 97 members of the Nakajima faction, which is close to the military, and 4 of 10 members of the Konko faction abstained or were absent. Of the 34 members of the pro-war Shakai Taishūtō party, 10 abstained or were absent. 5 of 30 members of the Jikyoku Doshikai abstained. Of the 10 independent members, 1 objected and 7 abstained. The result of the vote was a total of 303 votes, 296 in favor and 7 against, and the expulsion was confirmed."

 NW_JAP.26.d: "In comments to journalists, Saito said that he was not upset by the events, as he is confident that he is valued by the electorate and will be able to return to work in the Seimas after the next elections. The consequences for the parliamentary parties were much more severe. This incident clearly showed within each of the parties, not, as it seemed before, only within Rikken Xuekai. Moreover, the tendency to "pact with the military" drove the democratic Rikken Minseitō to the point where it expelled its member from parliament rather than supporting him. This severely undermined her credibility with her constituents and their hopes for parliamentarianism. Shakai Taishūtō was finally overrun by her nationalist faction willing to cooperate with the military - Hisashi Aso achieved his goal and emerged above party founder Abe Isoo, who had virtually withdrawn from political activity. But most importantly, the final vote showed how many members of parliament were unwilling in principle to choose between punishing Saito and supporting him, apparently fearful of threats to them from radicals."

Lu (or Jiao-liao) is a nationality living in Shandong and belonging to the Han Chinese. The idea of their own state for this people was defended by one of the officers of the Manchurian army Date Junnosuke, a Japanese, ronin, politician and adventurer, who had long been engaged in various conspiracies mainly in the territory of China, but he was also known for having shot two of his abusers who attacked him when he was still at school. In Japan he was closely associated with radicals such as Shūmei Ōkawa, Ikki Kita and Onisaburo Deguchi. After moving to China, he became a close friend of one of the famous and terrible warlords as Zhang Zongchang, and even made a brotherhood pact with him in 1929 and changed his name to Zhang Zongyuan."

The most likely suspects - agents of counterintelligence of the Kuomintang, who allegedly received information about secret negotiations between Tang and the Japanese military in order to head the puppet government of China. The assassins managed to get right into Tang's house thanks to his predilection for collecting antiques. Having acquired very rare porcelain vases from the Song era, they offered them to the famous politician. It was during the deal that the unfortunate hit came. The Kuomintang government has already pledged to compensate the family for the funeral expenses and submit Tang's lifetime achievements to the State Committee for the Compilation of Official History, but the public will still be outraged by the blatant murder."

It is said that Kita called for abandoning hopes of national reconstruction by a coup in favor of a politically sound reorganization centered on proper relations with China. Nakano was accompanied by his regular advisers and was able to interview Chiang Kai-shek early in the new year - it was not exactly their first meeting. Nakano returned to Japan today and addressed Foreign Minister Kōki Hirota, publicizing the interview with Chiang in the newspaper, to call for high-level action in that direction.

The Army asked to end the war diplomatically on milder terms because its main objective was war with the Red Army in the Soviet Far East and to fight it it was necessary to avoid an endless war of attrition in China.

In response, the Nationalist government also decided to summon the ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiyin, back home.

Moreover, [FROM.GetLeader] said he hoped for the establishment of "a new Chinese government based on the overthrow of the government of the [CHI.GetLeader]», and then the war could be over.

 NW_JAP.54.d: "The failed coup attempts in 1931 by the Sakurakai, a secret society in the junior ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army officer corps that promoted a vision of a militaristic totalitarian state socialist system as an alternative to the current corrupt party politics, inspired other groups in the military to make similar plans. Two major ideological factions emerged in the army: the Tōseiha and the Kōdōha, which began to feud with each other. In 1934, a group of five cadets at the Imperial Japanese Army Military Academy, led by two army officers belonging to the radical militarist imperial Kōdōha faction at the academy, worried about the impending loss of their faction's influence over the armed forces after the dismissal of Army Minister Sadao Araki in January 1934, formed their own plan to overthrow the government. However, in early November 1934, the conspiracy was foiled by the intelligence services because information about it was revealed by one of its members. In March 1934, one of the leaders of the first faction, Nagata Tetsuzan, was appointed chief of military affairs at the Ministry of the Army of Japan, which intensified the persecution of the opposing faction. Because of this, Colonel Aizawa Saburō, who shared the views of the young officers of the Imperial Way faction, assassinated Nagata as responsible for the repression in the army.\n\n\n\nIn the present, the trial of the assassin has begun in Tokyo, but his defenders, also members of the Kōdōha , have decided to use it as a platform to promote their ideas."

Their defense is based on the fact that the assassinated general was guilty of purges and splitting the army into separate factions, which undermined its combat effectiveness. At the same time, they continued to spread propaganda of their own ideology of "Shōwa restoration" in the courtroom in front of a large media crowd. The trial itself ended with a rather predictable decision - the death penalty for Saburō Aizawa."

And they were unexpectedly won by the opposition Rikken Minseitō party, which before these elections changed its rhetoric to more militaristic in order to gain popularity among the voters. Not least in Minseitō victory was the split in the Seiyūkai after the vote of no confidence: about 20 people left the party and formed the independent Shōwakai group, which continued to support the Okada government."

Their leaders, a group of young officers belonging to the radical Kokutai Henry-ha faction, similar in its principles to the Kōdōha faction, handed Emperor Hirohito their "Manifesto of Rebellion," in which they put forward their demands for a change in government policy: the dismissal of some of the top officers, and the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki is the leader of the Kōdōha faction in the army and was removed from his position as chief of general staff in the middle of last year by imperial decree."

 NW_JAP.59.d: "Without any communication with the outside world, having found himself blocked in his own palace by rebellious Guard units, the emperor had to sign an abdication for himself and his young son. Thus, the throne passed to Hirohito's younger brother Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, who had been on friendly terms with the army leaders of the Kodoha faction since the early 1930s.\n\n\nIn a long time, until Hirohito could not find his offspring, Yasuhito was considered the heir to the throne, but in 1933 he passed the post to Akihito, the emperor's son. In addition, Prince Chichibu, even after the first attempted military coups in the early 30s, demanded that his older brother introduce direct imperial rule in order to restore order in the country and implement the necessary reforms, so it is unclear how he will develop relations with General Masaki and the coup officers who put him on the throne."

However, he is said to have a nasty relationship with the emperor as well as many other members of the political elite. Because of this, it is assumed that the current cabinet will be a temporary one on the way to stabilizing Tokyo.

Several groups of soldiers, led by their officers, seized many government offices, surrounded the Imperial Palace, and began to carry out the liquidation of many politicians, officials, and military officers who were interfering, in their opinion, with "the Emperor's rule and the restoration of Japan's greatness." They delivered their "Rebellion Manifesto" to the Imperial Court, in which they make their political demands: the dismissal of some of the top officers, and the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki. Masaki is the leader of the Kōdōha faction in the army and was removed from his post as chief of general staff in the middle of last year by imperial decree. Admiral Keisuke Okada, the country's current prime minister, was among those killed by the rebels, so all power is now in the hands of the emperor."

 NW_JAP.61.t: "The Military's Procrastination"
 NW_JAP.61.d: "Senior army leaders appear to be uninvolved in the events, as they too are in a state of confusion. In addition, the intra-army confrontation between the two factions (Kōdōha and Tōseiha) is still going on, as both are trying to use the uprising for their own personal goals in order to take down the opposing faction. However, it should be noted that both factions are afraid to call what is happening a "rebellion" or "mutiny" in order not to spoil the reputation of the army and its best units, the Guards, since it was the Guards infantry unit that committed this daring act. Against this background, the Navy's actions look much more dignified. Admiral Yonai, commander-in-chief of the Tokyo Maritime District, has already issued a statement in which he called the rebels "rebel troops," brought about 40 ships into the capital's harbor, took the Maritime Command building under guard, and said that the sailors are ready to defend the Imperial Palace if necessary. \At this time, two groups of forces have formed within the army, offering their own vision of further events: on the one hand, the Supreme Military Council, an unofficial body uniting the leaders of all army leaders, dominated by supporters of the Kōdōha faction. They favor a peaceful resolution to the incident, offering their services as negotiators, including General Masaki, with whom the rebels have confirmed their willingness to negotiate. On the other side is the General Headquarters, where Tōseiha forces are concentrated, who favor decisive action and refusal to negotiate with the rebels."

However, it should be noted that before this, the members of the Supreme Military Council arbitrarily handed over to the rebels a statement of de facto recognition of their demands, which can be characterized as the Supreme Military Council's solidarity with the rebels.\n\nAt the same time, General Hajime Sugiyama, the head of the General Staff and a staunch supporter of Tōseiha, once again declared that the rebels must be crushed if they are not willing to lay down their arms."

The fleet's quick response satisfied him, but the army's hesitation was inexplicable to the emperor. When some members of his entourage spoke in defense of the officers' motives, Hirohito angrily replied that "killing my ministers is tantamount to strangling me," and added that the rebels deserved no leniency. At one point Hirohito became so impatient that he threatened to take personal command of the Imperial Guard and order them to attack the rebels themselves."

The rebels had little chance; about half of them surrendered as soon as the first shots were heard from the government troops, but the rest resisted. All of the rebel leaders died along with their soldiers, whom they condemned to death by their thoughtless actions. However, we still don't know who else was involved in this coup: we can investigate in which one of the army factions will finally try to destroy its rival."
 NW_JAP.65.a: "They should be posthumously sentenced"
 NW_JAP.65.b: "We need to conduct a full investigation into the incident"
 NW_JAP.67.t: "Putsch Suppression"
 NW_JAP.67.d: "The young infantry guardsmen's punt was finally resolved when Sugiyama, head of the General Staff, succeeded in getting the rebels to surrender without a fight by spreading the message that the Emperor did not support their demands and demanded an immediate end to the rebellion. Airplanes flew over the rebels scattered propaganda sheets with these words, and negotiators were sent to them. Most of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered. The soldiers dispersed to their barracks and were promised forgiveness if they did so."
 NW_JAP.67.a: "They should be court-martialed."
 NW_JAP.67.b: "We need to conduct a full investigation into the incident"
 NW_JAP.68.t: "Decisive Action by the Naval Command"
 NW_JAP.68.d: "Hirohito, having lost any trust in his own army commanders, who were mired in internal squabbles and disrupted the unity of the army, decided to trust Admiral Yonai to put down the rebellion. He sent loyal naval units to guard the imperial palace, and then distributed his proclamation to the rebels, in which he informed them that the emperor did not support their demands and waited for them to disperse to their barracks. In case of failure to comply with these decrees, the admiral would have to resolve the incident by force using his available shipboard artillery. The bulk of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered. The soldiers dispersed to their barracks and were promised forgiveness if they did so."
 NW_JAP.68.a: "They should be court-martialed."
 NW_JAP.68.b: "We need to conduct a full investigation into the incident"
 NW_JAP.69.t: "The Prime Minister's Miraculous Survival"
 NW_JAP.69.d: "The rebels aimed to assassinate seven major political and military figures who, in their opinion, hindered the development of the state and the emperor's rule. They were the last genro Saionji Kinmochi, Prime Minister Keisuke Okada, politicians Makino Nobuaki, Saitō Makoto, Takahashi Korekiyo and Kantarō Suzuki, and military leader Jyōtarō Watanabe. In the end, Watanabe, Makoto, Korekiyo and, as was believed throughout the incident, Prime Minister Okada were all killed. It turned out that he was saved by his own son-in-law - Colonel Denzo Matsuo, who pretended to be the prime minister, while Okada himself hid in the attic of his residence. The rebels, having killed Matsuo, thought their task was accomplished and did not search the entire building. When the incident was over, the prime minister managed to escape from his hiding place. The emperor now asks Okada to return to his duties, but the admiral feels that he has disgraced himself by allowing the coup to take place, so he feels it necessary to resign and be replaced by someone else."
 NW_JAP.69.a: "That's his choice."
 NW_JAP.69.b: "Inform him that it was the navy that put down the coup."
 NW_JAP.70.t: "New Prime Minister"
 NW_JAP.70.d: "After already former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada failed to reclaim the post, the emperor will have to choose a new head of government. The last genro who miraculously survived the incident, Saionji Kimmochi, had originally proposed Fumimaro Konoe, but he declined the position due to illness. The emperor was then offered Hirota Kōki, the foreign minister from the previous government, instead. He was a man from a simple family, not belonging to any party or faction, but excelled in his diplomatic duties. Hirohito asked Saionji whether a man of such low prestige should be appointed to the post, but the elderly and liberal-minded genro said it did not matter."
 NW_JAP.70.a: "We'll trust that advice"
 NW_JAP.71.t: "Successful Negotiations with Okada"
 NW_JAP.71.d: "After Emperor Hirohito had a private conversation with Keisuke Okada, in which he spoke about the excellent actions of the fleet during the incident, as well as expressed his personal confidence in the prime minister and asked for help in such a difficult time for the country, the admiral had no choice but to agree to postpone the decision to resign from his post."
 NW_JAP.71.a: "Okada will continue to do his thing after all"
 NW_JAP.72.t: "Organization of the Tribunal"
 NW_JAP.72.d: "We have interrogated all 1,483 participants of the uprising and are ready to bring 124 of them to criminal responsibility. However, it is necessary to decide whether this military tribunal will be held in the same way as the previous ones (for example, the January Sabourō Aizawa tribunal), or whether to organize a secret trial in which the defendants will not have the right to legal representation, to call witnesses or to appeal.\n\n\n\nIn the first case, it will certainly be an additional blow to the prestige of the army, but on the other hand, it may allow to return it to the control of the civilian government. However, it could also lead to destabilization of the situation in the country."
 NW_JAP.72.a: "Organizing a regular court-martial"
 NW_JAP.72.b: "We'll hold a secret trial of the defendants"
 NW_JAP.73.t: "Sentencing"
 NW_JAP.73.d: "The court-martial was protracted due to its openness, as were all previous similar trials. During it, the rebel officers accused of mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the War Minister after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, most of them were found guilty and five were sentenced to death."
 NW_JAP.73.a: "A sad end"
 NW_JAP.74.d: "The trial was held in secret. The judges did not listen to the motives and intentions of the defendants - they only forced them to focus on their actions during their testimony. Thus, the trial was very different from a regular court-martial. The rebel officers charged with mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the Minister of War after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, all were found guilty, of whom seventeen were sentenced to death."
 NW_JAP.74.a: "A sad end"
 NW_JAP.75.t: "Yamashita Resigns"
 NW_JAP.75.d: "Major General Tomoyuki Yamashita, one of the leading members of the Kōdōha faction, has on several occasions called for leniency towards the rebel officers involved in the coup attempt, but having failed to achieve his goals, he realized that he had lost the Emperor's trust and decided to resign. Some higher officers consider Yamashita to be too skillful a military man, the loss of whom would cause a blow to the fighting ability of our army, and offer to persuade him to stay."

Yasuhito, realizing that attempting such half-hearted reforms behind his back would not eliminate political instability in the country, decided to send the prime minister into retirement. With this gesture, he has already proved that he is very different from his brother, who tried to minimize interference in politics. The emperor now faces a choice: either to take power into his own hands, putting a puppet figure in the post of prime minister, or to invite Ikki Kita - a cult figure among young officers."

 NW_JAP.80.d: "After Prime Minister Masaki took office in a literal coup d'état by a group of young officers, he realized that perhaps the greatest threat to him came from them, despite his abhorrent relationship with much of the political establishment. Therefore, he had to figure out how to get rid of the sword of Damocles hanging over him. A solution was quickly found - a one-time arrest of all officers involved in the February 26 incident by the Kempeitai secret police, so that they would not be able to bring the soldiers back to the streets. Just in case, several additional units were stationed in the neighborhood of the 1st Infantry Division barracks, disguised in civilian uniforms and whose loyalty was unquestionable."

 NW_JAP_news.5.d: "In the Empire of Japan, an incredible event has occurred - the new Emperor Yasuhito has decided to take power into his own hands, forcing his cabinet to submit directly to his will. This had not happened since the Meiji era, when the emperor had real power. Since the introduction of the constitution in 1891, emperors have interfered less and less in political life, and the previous Emperor Hirohito was a supporter of British-style monarchy, where the emperor plays a symbolic role and is merely a sovereign uniting the nation. The current emperor, however, being a military man and having become acquainted in this environment with radical reformers among the junior officers, now wants to put these ideas into practice, leading the country out of the political crisis that has engulfed it since the Great Depression."

 NW_JAP.83.d: "Ōkawa Shūmei has long led a double life: on the one hand, a quiet academic, philosopher and journalist, speaking out on hot political topics. Knowing several languages and visiting many countries, he gained fame in wide circles, including through the printing of his journals with articles.\n\n\nOn the other hand, in parallel with this was a secret life Ōkawa - as a member and organizer of secret political societies. And if during the 20-ies all these societies were engaged in theoretical developments and almost did not go "into the political environment", rather gathering their supporters, in the early 30-ies Ōkawa "went on the attack". His participation in the Manchurian Incident, which ended with the creation of Manchukuo, is hard to underestimate, given the more than a hundred lectures he gave around the country on the importance of capturing this piece of China. In parallel, preparations were underway for coups d'état in Tokyo, several attempts at which failed, eventually leading to Ōkawa's arrest and imprisonment. One of these attempts was supposed to have involved General Araki, the founder of the Kodoha faction. However, he served only about a year instead of the 7 years he was supposed to serve, and was released through collusion with the authorities. But now that General Masaki has come to power and lost control over a group of young officers who continue to demand radical reforms, the conservative generals in Kōdōha have no choice but to recall their old ties with Ōkawa and offer him a new deal: to enter the Kōdōha military."

This legendary man in the narrow political circle of the Japanese Empire was almost persona non grata, so radical were his proposals for restructuring the state system. Ikki is a socialist and an ultra-monarchist at the same time. However, the new Emperor Yasuhito is said to have been introduced to Kita in the early 1930s by his friends from the group of young officers who staged the recent coup d'état."

He tried to make it in the clearest possible form and called himself 'the guarantor of the imperial house.' He said that all the events that had taken place in the country after February 26 were the fruit of the Imperial Army conspirators who had long been trying to destabilize the country against the Emperor's opinion and wanted to "return the political system to the days of the Shogunate" in order to rule indiscriminately, deceiving ordinary people with beautiful promises. Now the prince has taken matters into his own hands and declared a period of state of emergency, necessary to restore order in the country and establish economic and political life."

He made an address to the nation through journalists and radio, where he called himself "the guarantor of the imperial house" and declared that all the events that had occurred in the country were the fruit of a conspiracy of people who wanted to restore the system of the Shogunate period, to prevent the emperor from caring for the nation and leading it to prosperity. He explicitly called them conspirators and people who had committed treason against the emperor.

However, the volume of mutual trade between the countries remained high as before. First of all, this was due to Japan's material dependence on foreign countries.\n\n\nThe next, in 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. Several attempts at peace talks then failed, and a few years later the war reached a stalemate - the Japanese could not effectively subdue the invaded territories, the Chinese could not regain their land.

As a sign of peace and the signing of the treaties, representatives of all three sides met at the Shanghai International Settlement Hall, where they affixed their signatures to the documents."

 NW_JAP_news.9.d: "Until a few months ago, the Empire of Japan made an agreement with the French government to close the railway from the ports of Indochina to China (in order to prevent the supply of arms to China, which is at war with Japan), and to introduce a small contingent of Japanese troops into northern Indochina to control the railway and support the suppression of the guerrilla movement. Also today, journalits reported that Japanese troops had dramatically increased their numbers into Indochina and occupied the southern part of Indochina. The Japanese government has not commented on this situation in any way, but reports from the field indicate that it was the unauthorised prank of another Japanese general, which was swallowed by the Japanese government. Both the resources of Indochina and its strategic location as a springboard for attacking other Asian colonies of European powers are now under Japanese control."
 NW_JAP_news.9.a: "This is crossing all boundaries!"
 NW_JAP.119.t: "Measures against Japan"
 NW_JAP.119.d: "The Empire of Japan has committed another act of conquest in Asia by occupying the whole of French Indochina, after it had already been able to station a limited contingent in its northern part by agreement with the French authorities. This confirms Japan's further intentions, and also threatens our trade with French Indochina, as we get tin and rubber from there. Many in the government believe that it is time for a trade embargo on Japan, which will prevent her from buying oil, which is the blood of her warfare."
 NW_JAP.119.a: "Yes, we're embargoing!"

 NW_JAP.123.d: "Japan's ambassador to Washington expressed hope for the resumption of talks between the two countries to restore trade relations and resolve the China incident, as the Japanese call it. He also expressed his condolences over another outing by the military occupying Indochina. The Japanese proposal is to resume the draft agreement previously discussed, which involves withdrawal of Japanese troops from China, recognition of Manchukuo-Go by the US and China, recognition of the Chinese government by Japan, and restoration of trade between Japan and the US."
 NW_JAP.123.a: "We agree to that."
 NW_JAP.123.b: "The Japanese must first show that they are not in favour of aggressive policies"

 NW_JAP.124.d: "We have managed to find a possible path for negotiations - a return to the old draft agreement, which provides for a US-brokered armistice with China, resumption of trade, recognition of Manchukuo and withdrawal of troops from China. The last point is the most painful - we need to get our military to agree to it."
 NW_JAP.124.a: "We have the capacity to do that."
 NW_JAP.124.b: "Unfortunately, Army officials have their own vision of the agreement with the US"
 NW_JAP.125.t: "The New Demands of the Japanese Hawks"
 NW_JAP.125.d: "The Japanese foreign minister proposed a new draft of a possible agreement between the countries - now it became even more brazen: the Japanese in it are committed to withdraw troops from China within 25 years, but are ready to withdraw troops to the north of Indochina in exchange for the restoration of trade relations. The Japanese ambassador also said that if the supporters of the peace talks fail to fulfil their aspirations, the supporters of war with the United States will finally take power in the country, and then tragedy will not be avoided."
 NW_JAP.125.a: "Were the current proposals made by the supporters of peace?"
 NW_JAP.126.t: "The U.S. Refuses the Offer"
 NW_JAP.126.d.a: "Our Foreign Minister recently handed over new terms on which an agreement could be concluded. They were written under the strong influence of the army top brass. To expect the Americans to agree to them was naive folly, which is exactly what happened - the American Secretary of State said that the negotiation process would not begin until Japan proved that she did not support an aggressive policy."
 NW_JAP.126.d.b: "$NW_JAP.126.d.a$\n\nOur last hope may be a personal meeting between the two leaders of states, which our ambassador in Washington has suggested. He knows that Prime Minister Konoe has always been in favour of such talks, and besides, he is an opponent of war with the United States, so he will be ready to do anything to prevent it."
 NW_JAP.126.a: "This is the end."
 NW_JAP.126.b: "Konoe is our last hope!"
 NW_JAP.127.t: "A Face-To-Face Meeting of the Leaders"
 NW_JAP.127.d: "The Japanese ambassador to Washington is not giving up hope for negotiations. Now his new proposal is a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders of state somewhere in Hawaii. Current Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe is a very controversial personality. He is the only one who is accepted by the army as prime minister, and besides, he is a supporter of rather fascist ideas in the Japanese government, there are many radical politicians in his entourage. But at the same time he is a staunch opponent of war with Western powers, his "political mentor" was the last elder statesman of Japan, Genrō Kimmochi Saionji, an absolutely pro-Western liberal politician who once represented his country at the Paris Peace Conference after the Great War. Konoe's son, however, had himself studied in the United States in the early 1930s and when his father visited he had a private, unofficial meeting with President Roosevelt."
 NW_JAP.127.a: "We agree to a meeting, but before the meeting we need to agree on the outcome of the meeting."
 NW_JAP.127.b: "We're willing to meet, but we'd rather do it in Alaska, in the town of Juneau."
 NW_JAP.127.c: "We do not see the meeting as a possible scenario for negotiations."
 NW_JAP.128.t: "prerequisites"
 NW_JAP.128.d: "The American president is ready to go to a personal meeting with Prime Minister Konoe, but to organise it, it is necessary to initially show that Japan is not pursuing an aggressive invasive policy, which is the American demand. Otherwise, a meeting between the leaders would be misunderstood by the public and other countries. Such a gesture could be the withdrawal of troops from Indochina. However, again, to do such a thing, we need to influence the army top brass."
 NW_JAP.128.a: "We have this opportunity!"
 NW_JAP.128.b: "That seems like an impossible task. I'd rather resign. I guess so."
 NW_JAP.130.t: "The Consent of the Americans"
 NW_JAP.130.d: "The American government has agreed to our ambitious proposal. The meeting will still be held in Alaska, in Juneau, and not, as originally planned, in Hawaii. Konoe must do all this secretly enough that the people who want to eliminate him will not be able to do anything about it. From a conspiracy point of view, Alaska is even better than Hawaii."
 NW_JAP.130.a: "Prince Konoe, please hurry up and get in the car to the airport!!"
 NW_JAP.131.t: "The Americans Are Offering Mediation"
 NW_JAP.131.d: "We have been notified by the American Government that they will shortly hold talks with Japanese representatives concerning the withdrawal of their armies from the invaded countries of Asia.

Preparations for this meeting had already been underway for weeks - almost in secret, as it had opponents in both countries. But this meeting was needed as air to avoid the war that was already on the horizon after the United States imposed a trade embargo on Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, a staunch opponent of war with the U.S., was able to negotiate in a private meeting with the American president a U.S.-brokered peace between China and Japan, as had once happened in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, on the following terms: the US lifts any restrictions on trade with Japan, the US recognises Manchukuo as an independent state, Japan recognises the current Chinese government with the condition that it includes politicians from the pro-Japanese governments in the occupied territories, Japan withdraws all its troops from China. After the conclusion of the conference, journalists were invited to the announcement of the terms of peace, as well as to the solemn part - the mutual handshake of the two leaders, which was an important symbol of the meeting.

Some people began to rejoice with enthusiasm at the conclusion of the Chinese incident and the fact that war with the United States had been avoided and that Japanese financial assets had been unfrozen. Others, predominantly military officers and people with a military stream, began to demonstrate in the streets of Tokyo. The officers themselves do not believe that the entire army, which had been involved in battles with the Chinese, could be quietly withdrawn to Japanese soil. Prince Konoe returned to Haneda Airport, which had been cordoned off beforehand to prevent unnecessary unrest. However, threats are already being made towards the prime minister by the most radical members of the army and politics. After a meeting of the former prime ministers, it was decided that the emperor should make an address to the nation confirming the withdrawal of troops from China."

The identity of the assassin was surprising - it was General Masanobu Tsuji, who attempted to commit the crime with his katana. Konoe's personal driver rushed at Masanobu, who was approaching the prime minister, but was not in time - the distance was too close, and the general acted with lightning speed. Despite the attempt to get the prince to the hospital quickly, he lost consciousness extremely quickly - the katana pierced his stomach through, and the loss of blood was monstrous."

The Japanese "doves of peace" had long claimed that the supporters of war in their country had many forces, and more importantly, radical supporters ready to commit such a heinous act. One of them was General Masanobu Tsuji - with each new act of terrorism, done by the military in Japan, the ranks of the killers grew and grew, and reached such high ranks. The man who saved Asia from a major war could not find a response in his homeland. The President of the United States [USA.GetLeader] has already called it a "crime against peace and Asia" and expressed his condolences to the Japanese people and the Konoe family. Some suggested that this would turn the whole situation around, but no - the emperor himself addressed the nation and supported the Prime Minister's course on the eve of the assassination and what's more the killer-general has already been arrested and is being prepared for trial."

The Manchurian conference between  the representatives of Mongolia and Manchukuo was held in 1935 to establish the border between these states, as the positions of the Soviet and Japanese sides do not coincide on this issue - the maps were too inaccurate. Because of this, over the past few years there have been constant armed clashes on the border between the two countries.

The resolution was almost unanimously supported by the Congressmen. The speech itself was broadcast live on radio, and it drew the largest audience in American history, with more than 81 percent of people listening to the President's address.

It had long been clear that Moscow and Tokyo were behind the two governments in North China, but most analysts were inclined to believe that the antagonistic atmosphere between them would not provide an opportunity to find a formula for peace.

The declaration itself, importantly, is signed by the Emperor himself, further emphasising the importance and status of the document. The Prime Minister made an official statement in front of journalists, at which the declaration was announced, and later it was published in the country's newspapers.

After the session began, the Prime Minister of Japan made a speech outlining the official position of the Japanese Empire on the situation in the so-called 'Greater East Asia'. [JAP.GetLeader] criticised the actions of other great powers that continue to keep Asian countries in their colonial shackles. According to [JAP.GetLeader], 'the growing prestige and power of Japan was viewed with increasing hostility by America and England', forcing Japan to take military action to protect itself from attack by these states. The Japanese Prime Minister referred to the military action in East Asia and the Pacific as the 'Great East Asian War'. This war, he said, was aimed at 'destroying evil and restoring justice' and was supported by the peoples of Greater East Asia, for which the Prime Minister publicly thanked the delegates representing these peoples."

Delegates noted that the League was in fact defending the interests of Western colonialism without regard for the position of the indigenous peoples of the colonies.\n\nAt the end of the speeches inside the Parliament building, the delegates moved outside. At the front of the building, a structure was erected with a large Japanese flag in the centre and the flags of all the countries attending the conference on the sides.

He spent those days hiding in the attic of his own house, where he was never found. However, when he appeared before the Emperor, he resigned, feeling that he was responsible for the mutiny and that he had deceived the Emperor by faking his death.

Кроме того, в это же время военные гордятся собой… политическая идеология укрепления диктатуры всегда происходит из армии. \n\nВ целом он раскритиковал вмешательство военных в гражданское правительство, вспоминая недавние инциденты, особенно попытку путча в начале 1936 года. После этого слово взял министр армии Тераучи: \n\n- Последние слова заставляют меня чувствовать, что меня и военнослужащих здесь презирают.\n\nХамада уточнил: \n\n- Пожалуйста, приведите факты о том, что оскорбило армию в моих словах. \n\n- Это прозвучало как оскорбление. - перефразировал Тераучи. \n\nХамада снова вышел и сказал, что если Тераучи докажет оскорбление армии в его словах, то он совершит харакири, но если нет, то его должен будет совершить Тераучи.

Так как Хироте пришлось уйти в отставку из-за конфликта с армией, то принц Коноэ хочет реализовать свою старую идею для успокоения амбиций военных – дать им возможность сформировать правительство, рассчитывая на то, что они неопытны в этом вопросе, и провалятся на этом пути через какое-то время, в результате чего будут дискредитированы в обществе. В соответствии с этим, он предлагает в качестве следующего премьера генерала Сэндзюро Хаяси – бывшего министра армии из кабинета Окады, ушедшего в отставку осенью 1935 года.

Это очень неоднозначная рекомендация из-за той репутации которая сложилась вокруг генерала Угаки. С одной стороны, он участвовал в мартовском заговоре 1931 года по военному перевороту, и лишь в последний момент отказался поддержать заговорщиков. С другой, он занимался модернизацией армии путём сокращения её численности благодаря чему обрёл ненависть среди части офицеров, которым не нашлось места в новой армии. Кроме всего этого, Угаки в последние годы стал близок к партийным политикам и особенно партии Риккен Минсейто.

Сложилось мнение, что именно за продвижение этой политики Такахаси был убит во время путча 26 февраля. Из-за этого новые министры финансов не желают повторять судьбу своего предшественника и предлагают увеличенный бюджет, чтобы удовлетворить желания военных, даже несмотря на угрозу нового витка инфляции.

 NW_JAP_news.19.d: "General Kejisuke Ugaki became the new Prime Minister of the Empire of Japan. He is a well-known figure in Japanese politics, having been the Minister of War in the late 1920s, when he attempted to modernise the army by cutting its budget, much to the discontent of many officers. However, he managed to build up a sufficient faction of supporters. A series of unfortunate scandals in the early 1930s, including an attempt to take part in a failed coup d'état, cost him his position and influence. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of peace with the Western powers and the preservation of the previous political regime. It is worth noting that, according to journalists, the formation of the general's cabinet was not without difficulties and resistance from the army elite."

After this proposal, the Diet exploded with a thousand arguments and discussions. Hirota managed to bring the supporters and opponents of the idea together, thus avoiding unnecessary problems. The Diet was roughly evenly divided, although one might have expected the idea to be universally rejected in the Diet. However, almost all the smaller parties, as well as Tōhōkai and part of Shakai Taishūtō, supported the idea.

He destroyed its reputation in Parliament at the expense of his position as Prime Minister by making a recent speech and 'renewing' real support for the idea.\n\nWhen Hirota heard those words from Genrō Saionji Kinmochi, his previously sad mood changed dramatically.

Now the Genrō himself might well recommend to the Emperor that the leader of the dominant party in the Diet, Rikken Minseitō, be entrusted with the formation of a new government."

 NW_JAP.195.d: "A series of assassinations of senior politicians and businessmen in early 1932, culminating in the murder of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on 15 May, revealed the existence of a secret ultra-nationalist sect led by the self-styled Buddhist preacher Nisshō Inoue. After a number of mystical experiences in 1923-24, he came to believe that Japan needed a spiritual revival and that he was called to be its saviour. He founded a school in Ibaraki Prefecture to promote agrarianism and social reform, which gradually became a training centre for right-wing radicals. He devised the slogan 'ichinin issatsu' ('one person, one kill') and drew up a list of twenty politicians and business leaders whose assassination would be the first step toward restoring supreme political power to the Emperor, a platform known as the 'Shōwa Restoration'.\n\nAt this time, with the help of Mitsuaki Tanaka, former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan, he met right-wing figures such as Shūmei Ōkawa and Ikki Kita, and received enthusiastic support from radical young officers at the nearby Tsuchiura naval base. In 1930 Inoue moved to Tokyo, where he set about building the Ketsumeidan organisation by recruiting members among radical university students. The group was officially founded in 1932 with 13 young officers, with the aim of overthrowing the political and economic elite of the time. The group's first wave of assassinations came in early 1932, when former finance minister Junnosuke Inoue was shot dead on 9 February and Baron Dan Takuma, director-general of the Mitsui zaibatsu, was shot dead on 5 March in what made headlines under the general title 'League of Blood Incident'."

Many members of the Japanese public began to sympathise with the conspirators' aims, if not their methods. After this incident, the defendants began to use the defence line of acting in the interests of the Emperor. Abbot Rinzai Gempō Yamamoto testified in favour of his former disciple, justifying his violence from a Zen and imperialist point of view. In November 1934, Inoue and three Ketsumeidan militants were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe 11 assassins of the Prime Minister were tried by court-martial, but before sentencing the court received a petition signed in blood by 350,000 people throughout Japan in solidarity with the defendants' views and loyalty to the Emperor; later the court received a letter from 11 young men from Niigata who wished to be executed instead of the officers, the envelope containing seven fingers cut off as a sign of the seriousness of their intentions. As a result, they received much lighter sentences, despite the seriousness of their crime."

 NW_JAP.197.t: "Skeleton in the Closet"
 NW_JAP.197.d: "Nissho Inoue was the only one who dared to realise the ideology of Nichirenism, a nationalistic interpretation of the Nichiren doctrine that originated in Japan in the 13th century. Its main populariser was Tanaka Chigaku, a famous orator, writer and propagandist. In 1908 he moved to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, where in 1911 he wrote his most famous work, The Doctrine of Saint Nitiren, which presents the radical 13th-century priest Nitiren as the protector of the Japanese nation and calls for the unification of the world through Nitirenism, with the emperor as its nucleus. 'The very purpose of Japan's existence,' he wrote, 'is to realise this plan as a country designed to build Nitiren Buddhism'. In 1914 Tanaka united all his followers into a single organisation, the Kokuchūkai, based in Miho. As he grew older, he became increasingly convinced that Japan's seizure of Manchuria in 1931 was ordained by God and part of a divine plan to spread 'true' Nitiren Buddhism throughout Asia.\n\nKanji Ishiwara joined his followers, such as Nissho Inoue, after his trip to Germany in the 1920s. Partly based on these ideas, Ishiwara formulated his own concept of the 'Last War'. In addition, the notorious ideologue Ikki Kita had close links with Tanaka and his organisation. And now in a position of power, the followers of Nichirenism asked Ishiwara to pardon the conspirators of 1932, led by Nissho Inoue, who were serving life sentences."

The military is demanding an expanded deficit budget in order to increase investment in military industry. It has recently been given a new tool to put pressure on the government - the ability to influence the formation and approval of the cabinet by reinstating the rule that only serving officers can become army ministers. This rule was abolished in 1913 after the country's constitutional crisis. Its return immediately led to a new crisis - the Emperor initially entrusted the formation of a new government to General Ugaki, an influential member of the old generation of the military, whom it was hoped would take control. He was never able to form a cabinet, however, as none of the serving officers agreed to take up the post of war minister. The Japanese people were shocked. Such direct military involvement in civilian government was out of line. General Ugaki was forced to resign in defiance of the Emperor's decree.

It included a wide range of scholars, journalists, bankers, businessmen and military officers. The exceptions were politicians and bureaucrats. As a result, the group was heavily skewed towards leftists and Marxists. For the same reason, in the course of their work they came to believe that liberal democracy was outdated, that parliament should be replaced by a corporate assembly, and that the economy should be built on more command and control principles.\n\nAlso today, on the initiative of the personal secretaries of Prime Minister Tomohiko Ushiba and Michizo Kishi, a small think-tank is being formed under the unofficial name of "Asameshikai" ("Breakfast Society"). The idea was to meet twice a month for breakfast at around eight o'clock in the morning.

To placate reformist sympathisers, he invited Eiichi Baba back into the government as Minister of the Interior, but to appease business interests he gave key posts in the Ministries of Finance and Trade to career bureaucrats Okinori Kaya and Shinji Yoshino."

 NW_JAP.214.t: "Tekigai-sō"
 NW_JAP.214.d: "The main residence of the Fumimaro Konoe family is an apartment in the Mejiro district of central Tokyo, but a few months before becoming prime minister, Konoe purchased a villa in the Ogikubo district of Suginami, a rural suburb of Tokyo. The villa had previously belonged to Irisawa Tatsukichi, chief physician of the Ministry of the Imperial Court during the Taishō period and head of the Faculty of Medicine at Tokyo Imperial University. It was built by the famous architect of the Meiji era, Itō Chūta. It features high ceilings as Irisawa promoted a western lifestyle, and an important change for him was the ability to sit at a high table on chairs rather than on the floor as was traditional in Japanese homes. There are also some exotic design details in the interior, reflecting Itō's travels to China, India and the Middle East.\n\nAfter buying it, Konoe redesigned the interior in a more Japanese style and added a kura, a traditional building used for storage. The villa is surrounded by 6,000 square metres of gardens. Konoe's chief preceptor, genrō Saionji Kinmochi, was invited to be the first guest in the new house. He slowly walked around the estate, looked at the gardens and named it Tekigai-sō. The Prince had originally intended to use it as a summer residence, but he liked the views and the rural tranquillity so much that he began to spend most of his time here. He even held his first press conference with journalists here in Ogikubo after his appointment as Prime Minister."

 NW_JAP.215.d: "When Konoe offered to rehabilitate communists convicted under the Peace Preservation Act, the entire political elite flinched - no one expected such a thing from the young Prince.\n\nThe question of banning communist activities has been a matter of absolute consensus among elites and ordinary politicians since the mid-1920s. All socialists have tried to dissociate themselves from communism in order not to be associated with this movement.\n\nOn the other hand, those who know Konoe well might have expected something like this, as his circle of close friends has always included a few Communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers."

A large costume party was held at her father's residence, to which many of the genrō's friends were invited. His loyal pupil Fumimaro Konoe could not stay away, especially as he was the same age as his daughter and they were also good friends.\n\nWhen most of the guests had gathered at Saionji's house, a black car pulled up. Its side door opened and, crouching down, stepped out... Adolf Hitler. Or rather, Fumimaro Konoe, who had dressed up as Hitler and even made his fringes look like the famous ones of the German Fuehrer (he has been trimming his moustache the same way for a long time). This was no longer news to the 90-year-old liberal Saionji. He had long realised that his 'heir''s political views differed from his own."

 NW_JAP.217.d: "The one-party movement has gained widespread support in the country and among the political elite. It is particularly popular among the reformist friends of Prime Minister Konoe. Today, representatives of the movement met with him at his Tokyo apartment. They floated the idea to the Prime Minister of putting pressure on the main political parties in Parliament by organising mass demonstrations of the movement's supporters outside their headquarters or the Diet building itself. Their demand would be for the parties to dissolve themselves. Konoe listened attentively, then got up from his chair, lit a cigarette and stared out of the window.\n\n'On the one hand, it's in my interest' - thought the Prime Minister - 'on the other, it's another political destabilisation...'.\n\n- If we act without fear, then... - he broke the silence of his interlocutor, - this story could develop into... - he stammered. Konoe turned sharply and shook his head in agreement: 'A coup d'état'...."

They made a lot of noise and began to disturb the people around them. After they unfurled their placards and started the rally, it became clear that they were activists of the One Party Movement. They started harassing those going in and out of the party offices, demanding that they dissolve or leave their parties. The total number of demonstrators in the two bases did not exceed one thousand."

 NW_JAP.219.d: "Tensions on the streets of Tokyo near the headquarters of Rikken Seiyūkai and Rikken Minseitō came to a head this evening when militants from both bases marched in columns straight to the doors of the party offices. They managed to disarm the Rikken Seiyūkai guards and occupied the party building, taking the people inside hostage. The Rikken Minseitō representatives were more fortunate, as the militants failed to break into their building, but were blocked by them inside. The militants are demanding that the party's members declare self-dissolution in support of the One Party Movement, arguing that the party's outdated ideological stance will only relegate it to the pages of history and that it should not interfere with the country's development.\n\nThe telephones at the Metropolitan Police Station have been ringing off the hook all day with persistent calls from the seized party offices. Indifferent onlookers have gathered outside the police, Parliament and party offices to watch the latest incident unfold. It is worth noting that the militants are unarmed, but either the police must finally do something or other political actors must take action, which is what the supporters of the One Party Movement are most likely waiting for."

Almost all the militants were arrested and taken to the stations, except for some of the luckiest and fastest young men, who were no longer available. The suspected leaders of the plot could not be arrested at once, but later they themselves surrendered to the police, one of whom turned out to be Tamakichi Nakamizo, one of the leaders of the One Party Movement and a man who had recently been seen at Prime Minister Konoe's apartment in Tokyo. He took full responsibility for what had happened. There is a remarkable silence in the newspapers - either everyone is in a wild state of confusion, or they do not want to risk the dissolution of the Government if the consequences of the incident are exaggerated, or they are lost in speculation as to what secret and invisible political struggle has been going on all this time that has led to such an incident, remotely reminiscent of some of the events of recent years perpetrated by military radicals. But everyone seems reluctant to draw such parallels."

 NW_JAP.221.d: "Kumao Harada is the personal secretary of the last genrō, Kinmonchi Saionji, and as such he has a reputation, if not as a grey eminence, then at least as an important person in the highest political circles. He is constantly mentioned in the newspapers in the event of another political article, and when he is seen on the streets, he is always in a hurry, almost running, with a pile of papers under his arm. He is also a close friend of Prime Minister Konoe and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido, all three of whom are young aristocrats.\n\nToday's incident proves this intimacy between Konoe and Harada: Harada paid a surprise visit to the Prime Minister's residence late at night on important business, only to be warned that the Prince had already gone to bed. So he went straight to the bedroom and discovered that Konoe was actually sleeping with Harada's wife. Harada, who had often complained to Konoe about his bad relations with women, kicked his wife out of the bedroom and lay down on the futon with Konoe, having secret talks until morning."

He also blamed China for the ongoing conflict. When Konoe was later asked for clarification, he said he meant more than just not recognising the Kuomintang regime - he had 'rejected it' and would 'destroy it'.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the government in Tokyo appears to have made a foreign policy move of its own - and it appears to be far more radical than anything the military in the Kwantung Army has done. Now there will be no negotiations between the two countries for a long time, and the fighting will continue."

In his last address, Konoe called it “a new phase of domestic politics.” The new prime minister himself was chosen to be Kiichirō Hiranuma, an old secretive schemer who had his own Kokuhonsha organization under his command, which openly supported totalitarian ideology.

Party leaders 12 hours later, realizing that they were endangering their comrades in vain, went to negotiate with the conspirators. They agreed to dissolve their parties, but all deputies retained their seats in the Diet. At 12 noon, Prime Minister Konoe made an address to the Diet, in which he announced the formation of a new political party, the Party of Great Japan, of which he himself became the leader. The speech drew loud applause, although it divided the Seim into two groups of people: the majority, those who clapped, and the silent minority, who watched haughtily.\n\n\n\nOn leaving the parliament building, Konoe did not yet know that outside the walls waiting for him was a cheering crowd, specially assembled and prepared, including from the militants who a few hours earlier had held members of the Rikken Minseitō and Rikken Seiyūkai. Throughout that day, the streets of the capital diligently portrayed the triumph of popular expression.

Hiranuma's stance dealt a death blow to the right-wing unification movement and decisively placed the Japanese in the ranks of the conservatives on the issue of reform.

It is worth noting their fundamentally different views on the country's foreign policy - Konoe still wants to find a settlement with Britain and the U.S., and Matsuoka nurtures ideas about a Eurasian alliance of Japan, Germany and the USSR, which he will be able to realize in the highest position.

 NW_JAP_news.32.d: "A representative of the traditional parliamentary party Rikken Seiyūkai, Chikuhei Nakajima, will head the new government of the Japanese Empire. It is worth noting that his party has long been seriously divided. Some of its leaders sabotage parliamentary work, violate party discipline and join the so-called “one-party movement,” which envisions a multi-party regime in the country. This is especially sad against the backdrop of how Japan seemed to have managed to stabilize the political situation and return to party-based cabinets."

 NW_JAP_news.33.d: "It is possible that the establishment of a stable democracy in the Empire of Japan is once again delayed - a working coalition to form a government has been assembled by Seigō Nakano, the creator of perhaps the only sincerely fascist party in the Japanese parliament. However, he still calls his ideology “totalism”. Moreover, it even includes the idea of returning to democracy after a certain period of dictatorship, obtained in a “constitutional” way through the parliament. The nationalist faction of the Shakai Taishutō party has agreed to join him in a coalition, but it is unlikely that this will be enough to realize all the plans of the new prime minister of Japan."

He himself emphasized the importance of this formal procedure and respect for the Meiji constitution in the process. In addition, he has even stated that he respects democracy, but under the circumstances, only such a parliamentarily formalized temporary dictatorship will help the country out of the crisis."

He managed to lead one of the two factions of the Rikken Seiyūkai Party after its collapse and to form skillful coalitions of supporters of different policies but united by the idea that the country needed complete political reform.

They began to set up some sort of camps near them and would not disperse. They fussed and made a lot of noise, starting to disturb the people around them. After they unfurled their placards and started the rally, it became clear who they were - militants of the Movement for One Party.

Either the old man Abe Iso and his centrist faction, which adheres to social-democratic attitudes, will become the leader of the party. Or give way to the young and assign the formation of the government to the main ideologist of the party, Hisashi Aso and his right-wing, national-socialist faction, who advocate the establishment of totalitarian rule in the country."

As planned, they will achieve their goals by completely legal means.\n\n\nThe new prime minister will now be Konoe, who will lead his own party, as he himself stated. The most surprising thing is that such an abrupt change of political plans will be supported both in the Seim, where the one-party movement has a broad coalition, and among the conservative political elites, thanks to the figure of Fumimaro Konoe - the young prince whom the elderly genro Saionji Kimmochi has been preparing his replacement all his life, which gives hope that Konoe will not make unnecessarily radical steps."

One of the stumbling blocks between them has always been the issue of labor unions. The Social Democrats believe that this is the most important organ of “workers' power” that must be supported and developed. The National Socialists, on the other hand, believe that trade unions, on the contrary, solve only the very difficulties of the working class, but do not eliminate the problem itself. In addition, they divide workers into two kinds: those who have joined a trade union and everyone else.\n\n\nThe National Socialist faction's decision not only to withdraw support from the unions, but also to launch a state struggle against them, could not but cause an explosion of discontent both among the unions themselves and within Shakai Taishūtō. Many say it was a thoughtless move by the party leaders."

However, the further Shakai Taishūtō's National Socialists drifted to the right on the political compass, the more they came to resemble those they opposed. Moreover, the parliamentary coalition with Seigō Nakano's Tōhōkai Party only reinforced these associations."

Clouds have long been gathering over the Machuda Chūji cabinet, but now they have crossed the last line since the monarch has taken such a step. The main thing is that this is a sign - there will be no further moves towards liberalization in Japan. There are two candidates for the role of interim prime minister until the next parliamentary elections: Prince Naruhiko, who thanks to his status will be able to keep everything in his hands, or diplomat Hirota Kōki, who is a non-partisan politician but is known for his democracy."

However, the question of relations with the state apparatus immediately arises: will the “new structure” be a mass socio-political movement independent of the state or a para-state structure under the control of the bureaucracy? In the first case, the movement will be able to subordinate the apparatus itself, and in the second case it will be subordinated to it. We will have to make this difficult choice, respectively gaining or losing the support of various politicians, military and financial groups."

These include military officers who tried to organize plots and coups, such as Kingoro Hashimoto. These include parliamentary politicians who wanted to do the same, but through more legal methods with the help of the House of Representatives - journalist Seigō Nakano and others. This group also includes Prince Fumimaro Konoe and his inner circle from the “think-tank” and some reformist bureaucrats who saw an opportunity to implement their plans with the help of the new organization: Fumio Gotō, Naoki Hoshino and Kishi Nobosuke."

 NW_JAP.257.d: "There is also another faction of supporters of the “new structure” - these are the more moderate politicians from the entourage of Kiichirō Hiranuma and his dissolved Kokuhonsha Society. However, their moderation is due to their political intentions: They do not need the “new structure” for any changes in the country, but as a tool to strengthen their personal power, to eliminate the changeability of power, or they are those politicians who want to get into ministerial seats with its help. They are mostly representatives of the Seiyūkai Party in the parliament."

And the first issue that the members of the Association moved to discuss was the draft of the “new economic structure” prepared by the Shōwa Research Association.

And it seems to be the final stroke in its helplessness. Recently, Kiichirō Hiranuma, a possible initiator of these amendments to the law, stated that the Association is not a “political” but only a “public” organization, despite earlier comments by other politicians."

Their place was taken by the influential industrialist Ogura Masatsune. However, to maintain bureaucratic balance, the project's main economic opponent, Kobayashi Ichizo, also resigned.

Or, on the other hand, the failure of the reformers is a chance to take the path of returning to parliamentary politics, as all attempts at reform in the country have proven to be a failure.

Journalists, including Japanese journalists and those officially allowed into the war zone by the army leadership, are adding fuel to the fire. For example, the case, which was covered by two Japanese newspapers, when two officers on the approach to Nanjing competed to be the first to slaughter 100 people with a sword - and their competition continued after this mark was reached, has already become widely known. If this massacre was not stopped, the morale of the troops would finally collapse and Japan would be irreparably damaged internationally.

Somehow, a land officer who had absolutely nothing to do with the local naval base managed to infiltrate it with a cold weapon and deliver a sneak attack, from which Yamamoto died almost on the spot. The news of this was a heavy blow to all who knew the admiral well. During an urgently convened government conference attended by the army minister, he was reprimanded by the emperor - an incredible gesture from the usually calm and composed monarch:\n\n- This is not just a blow to the Imperial Navy, it is a blow to the Imperial family and the emperor himself! It is likely that such harshness is due to Yamamoto's well-known closeness to the reigning monarch. It is expected that a solemn state funeral will be organized in the near future."

 NW_JAP.289.t: "Yamamoto Threats"
 NW_JAP.289.d: "The hatred of army officers for their naval counterparts continues to grow. Admiral Yamamoto is receiving an endless stream of hate mail from his opponents, as well as direct threats from Japanese nationalists, but he is very calm about the possibility of an attempt on his life. In an interview with reporters, he said:\n\n\n- To die for the Emperor and the Motherland is the highest honor for a military man. Flowers rise in the field where a hard, brave battle was fought. And even under the threat of death, a fighting man will be eternally loyal to the emperor and his land. The life and death of one man means nothing. The empire comes first. As Confucius said, “You can crush cinnabar, but you can't take away its color; you can burn flowers, but you can't destroy their scent.” They can destroy my body, but they can never subdue my will.\n\n\n\n0 Recently, senior army officers ordered the military police to “guard” the admiral. Many speculate that in reality, this is an attempt to 'keep him under control' because of his unwavering stance on the alliance with Germany.”"
 NW_JAP.289.a: "It's worth sending the Admiral to sea to save him from assassination attempts."
 NW_JAP.290.t: "The Conflict Between the Navy and the Army"
 NW_JAP.290.d: "During the past year a large number of army and navy officers have begun to speak out publicly against certain Japanese admirals. Isoroku Yamamoto, Mitsumasa Yonai, and Shigeyoshi Inoue have been particularly criticized because of their strong disapproval of a possible alliance with Germany and because of their opposition to plans to seize the “southern resource zone.” For example, Admiral Yamamoto Yamamoto did not personally support the invasion of Manchuria in 1931.\n/p Politically, he was in favor of a peaceful solution to all conflicts. He was strongly opposed to war with the United States, a position that came out of his training at Harvard, his service as an assistant admiral, and his service as naval attaché (twice) in Washington. He attended the second London Naval Conference in 1930 with the rank of Rear Admiral, and already with the rank of Vice Admiral at the London Naval Conference of 1934. The Japanese government believed that the cadre military specialist must accompany diplomats during the discussion of arms reduction.\n\n \n\nThe popularity of Yamamoto in the navy is incredibly high - he is loved by ordinary sailors and officers, as he has always treated them with deep respect. In addition, Admiral Yamamoto and Admiral Yonai have close ties to the Imperial Family, which further enhances their influence."

 NW_JAP.291.t: "The Hustle and Bustle at the Konoe Residence"
 NW_JAP.291.d: "Sayonji Kimmochi, who once considered Konoe as his protégé in resolving the political conflict, has left this world. Perhaps this explains the radical nature of the proposals that Prince Konoe has made. There was now no genro representative left to advise the emperor on the appointment of a prime minister during such a difficult period. Instead, the new Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kōichi Kido, canvassed the opinions of all former prime ministers as high-ranking statesmen (the so-called jushichi).\n\n\n\nThey quickly agreed that the army's position left no room for the appointment of anyone other than Prince Konoe. Before formally accepting the post of prime minister, Konoe held an extensive round of political discussions at his residence with the men who would occupy key positions in his cabinet: Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo, and Army Minister Hideki Tojo.\n/pThese talks were designed to maximize Konoe's influence over his cabinet. They were held under the veiled threat that Konoe would reject the emperor's offer to lead the government if his key ministers were unwilling to support his political views. Satisfied that this maneuver led to agreement, Konoe quickly formed his cabinet."
 NW_JAP.291.a: "Sly move"
 NW_JAP.292.t: "Konoe's Idea"
 NW_JAP.292.d: "More often than not, during Breakfast Society meetings, if Prince Konoe was present, he was usually silent, as if parodying the Emperor's behavior at Government Ministerial Conferences. Today's meeting, however, went drastically out of the ordinary. Konoe was suddenly the first to break the silence after the meeting began, beginning to speak of his views on the upcoming changes in the country's political structure. The prince argued that the institutional weakness of the premiership limited the prime minister's ability to control the political activities of the military. The political settlement during the Meiji period had deprived the cabinet of leverage in choosing between the priorities of the army and navy or in reconciling the military's views on national policy with those of other elite groups.\n\n\n To cope with these problems, Konoe proposed the establishment of a new political order in Japan. The cornerstone of the new system was to be a new political party that would unite all existing groups in the lower house, but would be led by himself as president. By holding the posts of party leader and prime minister simultaneously, Konoe believed he could strengthen the prime minister's position of control over the people, the lower house, the bureaucracy, and the military. Based on mass organization, the new party would provide channels for mobilizing people in the service of cabinet policies. The political leverage that the prime minister could gain through the support of the new party would strengthen his bargaining position with both the bureaucracy and the military."
 NW_JAP.292.a: "Finally waited... The prince realized what was expected of him"
 NW_JAP.293.t: "On Muted Tones"
 NW_JAP.293.d: "When Konoe finished his detailed plan of action in the event that he became prime minister, the people present were afraid to even speak for fear of scaring away the prince's fighting spirit that everyone had been waiting for. The prolonged silence was interrupted again by Konoe himself:\n\n\n- My plans will require a fundamental.... ahem. reinterpretation of the Meiji Constitution, which was designed specifically to ensure that power is distributed among several elite groups, rather than concentrated in the hands of a single individual or political party. - he spoke in a muffled voice, as if embarrassed by each successive word."

 NW_JAP.294.d: "On February 5 this year, the Japan Professional Baseball League was founded, and today the first season of the league began at the Tokyo Stadium. Baseball is a game that came to Japan from the United States, but has become a favorite of many urban dwellers in recent times. Previously, there were individual games between national teams, but now everything is organized at the national and official level with financial support from outside.\n\n\n\nThe radical military from the Kōdōha faction and some Japanese politicians are in favor of banning this sport as a “Western”, but it has a large number of supporters among very different influential politicians and businessmen. For example, Arima Yoriyasu, a close friend of Prince Konoe, a reformer, created his own team, the Tokyo Senators, similar to the American Washingtone Senators. Arima is also a major lobbyist and advocate in political circles.\n\n\nThe current season will be played by 7 teams: 3 from Tokyo, 2 from Osaka, 2 from Nagoya. It is also worth noting the international nature of the Japanese League - several teams are played by Americans, including blacks who could not find a decent place in their homeland because of the policy of segregation, and even one Russian immigrant - Victor Starfin."

 NW_JAP.299.t: "Activities of the Birth Control Movement"
 NW_JAP.299.d: "“Fertility hell” became a well-known phrase during the Great Shōwa Depression. The term, literally meaning the painful life caused by having many children, suggests the common perception of having many children as a symbol of an unhappy life. In reality, however, fertility was seen as a pressing issue among the lower class, who suffered from poverty and unemployment. Newspapers began to mention infanticide in both urban and rural areas. To cope with this population growth, the proletarian movement spread the idea of birth control or helping workers and the poor to solve this problem. Since 1934, representatives of the leftist movement have opened Birth Control Advisory Centers in major cities. They are headed by a feminist, Katō Shizue, who, after studying in the West, has absorbed a lot of left-liberal ideas. She argues that the problem of Japan's growing population can be solved by women. She believes that giving women control over their own reproduction will allow women to achieve greater independence and also allow for a society in which women take the lead. Another part of her argument is that birth control will help the people of Japan raise better children. She thinks that by having fewer children, women will be able to create better educational and economic opportunities for their children. In keeping with the “influence and respectability of eugenics,” Katō Shizue also supports eugenics, believing that children born to two healthy parents will be better off than children born to sick or weak parents. Such ideas may become too popular in society and lead us eventually to population decline, and thus inevitable defeat in competition with other, more numerous nations such as the Chinese, Russians or Americans. Now, due to the outbreak of hostilities, we have an official reason to isolate Katō from public life and close her Counseling Center."

However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister.

At the time of the active confrontation between Tōseiha and Kōdōha, the country was still a blank slate on which anyone could write, draw, or implement a new system.

 NW_JAP.313.d: "Today Ishiwara Kanji took direct intellectual leadership of the East Asian League and emphasized that the movement had failed in the Seim and should henceforth be seen “not as a political movement but as a true cultural, moral and ‘semi-religious movement’” that should serve as a force that the nation could use “to end the war in China and form an East Asian bloc.” And in society, “to become a motivating factor and a force for organizing people.” Ishiwara also introduced the movement as an “anti-war movement.”\n\n\n/n/n He also introduced a number of reforms in the movement, such as a mandatory membership fee (1 yen and 20 sen per year), which Ishiwara believed, despite the risk of alienating poorer farmers, would raise the level of determination and consciousness of members. The second major reform was the establishment of branches “adapted to local conditions and not limited to one branch in each prefecture.” This meant that local branches would have considerable autonomy and would be able to reflect local issues and culture. It was a measure that was to prove very important and stimulating, particularly for its largest branch in the Shōnai region, which includes the western part of Yamagata Prefecture, which is culturally and linguistically different from the eastern part and separated from it by high mountains."

The war in China has dragged on, the population is tired of it, and it's time to make peace - all this is confirmed by the growing popularity of the ideas of the irrepressible Kanji Ishiwara. The meeting of the emperor's advisers decided to entrust the formation of the cabinet to his supporters, but there are divided opinions about the candidacy of the prime minister - some believe that it should be Ishiwara himself, while others emphasize the need to let the parliamentary leader of the East Asian League - Kimura Takeo - prove himself. The main disconcerting thing about his candidacy is his age, as he would be the youngest cabinet chief in the country's history."

Sensing their weakness after the Young Officers' Putsch, they proposed the formation of the “February Society” as a basis for joint action and approached Nakano with the suggestion that the Tōhōkai take part in it. Although they were even prepared to give him a leading role in the new society, Nakano refused to consider any other course than direct affiliation of all other groups with his own party.

After a string of electoral successes, they have proven that it is their program and ideas that have won the trust of the voters. Although the leader of the Social Democratic faction, Abe Isu, will retain his post as party president, his position has waned amid the growing influence of Hisashi Asō, the party's general secretary and an ideologue who promotes totalitarian, socialist ideas.

While many still do not believe such a union is possible, and see it as an unlikely coincidence between the extreme right and left wings of parliamentary politics, the two parties hold similar positions on many issues, including supporting the interests of the military. In addition, some members of Shakai Taishūtō had already defected to Tōhōkai after the police crackdown on “Popular Front” cases - a response to the Comintern's current policy of forming a broad “popular front” among various left-wing organizations. or anti-fascist elements. In the view of many in the leadership of that party, a better alternative to the “popular front” would be a “national front” beginning with a merger with Tōhōkai."

However, Abe still agreed to the declaration proposed by Nakano, albeit with reservations about his own participation - despite this, it was immediately released to the media. Despite its brevity, it was dramatic in content: it spoke of fulfilling Japan's mission in East Asia by returning to the principle of “service to all the people,” which is at the heart of Japan's national policy that does not allow for “a policy of privilege, cliques, classes or complacency.” It said the parties, whatever their past differences, are united in concern for the nation and the people and, in true “Japanese spirit.” The parties expect sympathizers from all sides to join in the creation of a totalitarian national party, for which a preparatory committee will now be established."

During the banquet, major newspaper owners Tokutomi and Miyake, Shakai Taishutō general secretary Hisashi Asō and Nakano himself spoke. Tiamu, the third “Grand Elder” among prominent Japanese newspaper owners, was dissuaded from attending by fellow members of the Japanist camp, such as representatives of the Great Japan Production Party and the Kokurikai, who jointly accused Nakano of seeking to establish a “totalitarian unified national party of the Western pattern.” Thus, for a time, Nakano and Tiamu were once again separated by this kind of conflict, despite their recent restoration of relations.\n/pThe Preparatory Committee made some progress by choosing the name “Kakushin Shintō” (New Renewal Party), drafting a platform, and setting a date for the inaugural meeting.

The Shakai Taishūtō expected one of its leaders to be given the top position due to the larger number of members of parliament, but Nakano felt that since the basic principle was totalism and the Shakai Taishūtō was joining as a group of “rejects” of socialism, Nakano himself should be the main man in the new party.

Tōhōkai and Shakai Taishūtō could not agree on the leadership issue, but they issued a joint statement saying they would continue to maintain “friendly relations between the parties with an eye toward future possibilities.” This was a problem of the same kind that had prevented the formation of the February Society as the basis of the right-wing Renewalist association in 1936.

For example, he said that the possibility of an alliance with Shakai Taishūtō in the future has now been ruled out. In addition, he said that the experience had extinguished in him “the last spark of hope for parliament-centered political maneuvers.” At the end of the interview, he revealed some very intriguing news:\n\n\n- I have decided to directly address the realization of the crisis in Japan and fight for the establishment of a totalitarian Imperial Way Party."

Thus, Nakano's old colleague, Adachi Kenzō, agreed to continue the party merger talks, as did smaller associations and individual lawmakers and organizations.

Because of this and his sudden departure during a Sejm session, movements began among the two main parties to expel him from the Sejm. His own support in parliament was quickly eroded after the merger fiasco, and in the end only four Tohokai deputies remained party members. Much of this collapse was attributed to Nakano's excessive admiration for European fascist leaders, his close identification with the army line, and his generally dictatorial views - traits that many in his party hoped would be mitigated by the merger with Shakai Taishuto.\n\nOn his return to Japan, he found that he had no choice but to resign from the Diet. He rejected any suggestion that he might apologize from leaders of various parties. In a public statement, he said:\n\n- The recent failure was my ultimate disappointment in the new party, which is projected to rely on members of the Seimas, and I take full responsibility for this.

Rumors had already appeared in the newspapers that the failure of those negotiations was due to Ryutaro's secret machinations, during which he promised Adachi Kenzo, the leader of Kokumin Domei, the creation of a different party coalition, more popular in parliament and without Seigo Nakano, his rival. Ryutaro was now able to confirm these words - Adachi had agreed to his proposal to join.

They were the ones most opposed to the party's merger with Tohokai and Ryutaro Nagai was aware of this. It is not surprising, therefore, that his work to create a new party could not but affect these people, many of whom he managed to lure into his movement, which finally had a name.

They themselves justify their actions by a sense of self-preservation due to threats from radicals, since it was the representatives of big capital who were most antagonistic to the young officers as "the people who seized power in the country". Some still believe that using young officers as a tool, the representatives of the zaibatsu wished to carry out reforms in the country that were convenient for themselves and truly seize power.\n\nThe most surprising example of such a person was Fusanosuke Kuhara - one of the leaders of the largest parliamentary party Rikken Seiyukai, its general secretary.

First, a group of deputies broke away from the party to form the Shōwakai Party in protest of the Seiyukai's policies toward the then cabinet, and the 1936 parliamentary elections dealt a fatal blow to the party's leader, Kisaburo Suzuki. The near defeat in the election and the victory of their main rivals, the Rikken Minseito, with small parties growing in the background destroyed Suzuki's reputation within the party, and also undermined his morale and later his physical condition. It was only through the efforts of his relative, Ichiro Hatoyama, that he managed to win a seat in the House of Peers and retain influence in the party for a while longer. However, amid his deteriorating health, Suzuki announced today that he will step down as party president at the end of his term (in two years), but in the meantime the party will have a four-man collective leadership system: Ichiro Hatoyama himself, Yonezo Maeda, Toshio Shimada and Chikuhei Nakajima.

The latter's persistence in trying to bring a man linked to army conspirators back into the party is surprising, but it is rumored to be due to the increasing influence of the Chikuhei Nakajima faction in the Rikken Seiyukai. Nakajima, the owner of the largest zaibatsu that manufactures military and civilian airplanes, has been gradually seizing his power in the party by surrounding himself with people with so-called "pro-war views" in the Seiyukai. It is possible that a shared hatred for Nakajima's reinforcement allowed Hatoyama and Kuhara to overcome their difference of opinion, given the latter's political weight, connections, and influence."

It comes from the reformist faction of Chikuhei Nakajima and his various organizations: The National Policy Research Group and the National Institute for Economic Research, where scholars were invited to conduct research on the political and economic situation at home and abroad.

In their place, Fusanosuke Kuhara, Tadaso Mito, and Kenkichi Yoshizawa take their places in the collective leadership. This was reportedly done at the prompting of Ichira Hatoyama, who thus responded to the formation of the Rikken Seiyukai Innovation Alliance. Mito and Yoshizawa are believed to be people from Hatoyama's faction. In addition, it should not be forgotten that in the coming months the period of collective leadership in the Seiyukai is expected to end with the election of a new president and such a castling dramatically strengthens the position of the "heir apparent"."

The meeting was given additional legitimacy by the presence of 3 of the 4 collective presidents, Toshio Shimada and Maeda Yoneza, who have long openly supported Nakajima on almost all issues.

During this time, two camps clearly emerged in the Seiyukai: the pro-war Nakajima faction and the faction of Hatoyama, Suzuki's successor, which managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Ichiro Hatoyama now leads the country's oldest political party. It is said that Nakajima was extremely upset about this, but not feeling confident underneath himself, he did not dare to engage in divisive actions within the party. Especially since he had already formed a quite powerful, self-loyal Innovation Alliance group within the party a few months ago, without which Hatoyama's own legitimacy would be undermined. However, Hatoyama is rumored to be looking to further develop the party's image as a "pro-constitution" party, reaffirming its name and engaging in ideological confrontation with the more pro-war Rikken Minsaito."
 NW_JAP.346.a: "The Suzuki heir held on"
 NW_JAP.347.t: "Nakajima is the New President of the Rikken Seiyukai."
 NW_JAP.347.d: "As promised, the elderly formal president of the Rikken Seiyukai, Kisaburo Suzuki, finally steps down, announcing the election of a new leader and thus ending the period of collective leadership of the party. During this time, the Seiyukai clearly formed two camps: the faction of Hatoyama, Hatoyama's successor, who tried to keep the party from indulging in the military, and the faction of Nakajima, his ideological rival, who managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Chikuhei Nakajima now leads the country's oldest political party. As head of the zaibatsu, which produces aircraft, mostly military aircraft, he is actively involved with army and navy officers. Nakajima supports the expansionist aspirations of the army, but does not consider it necessary to eliminate the parliament, and offers them a convenient cooperation in his person. Hatoyama has been unable to reverse the trend within the party to support Nakajima; moreover, the latter has become an overly important financial backer of the party through his financial conglomerate."
 NW_JAP.347.a: "The army threat is upon us once again"
 NW_JAP.348.t: "Alliance for Reform Leaves Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.348.d: "Nakajima's reaction was not to be expected for long, as he announced the withdrawal of his Innovation Alliance from the Rikken Seiyukai in protest. This will severely undermine the party's position in parliament, as over the years Nakajima has managed to build a large faction of loyalists around him. It is true that the Seiyukai is not accustomed to such withdrawals from the party - this is exactly what happened in 1935 with the Shōwakai party - a group of former Seiyukai members who were dissatisfied with the lack of support for the current cabinet from the party leadership. However, the current situation is very different from the Shōwakai in that the Seiyukai leaders will now have to think about finding new sources of funding, as Nakajima had previously provided most of the investment from the income of his zaibatsu."
 NW_JAP.348.a: "Expected outcome"
 NW_JAP.349.t: "Hatoyama Elected President of the Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.349.d: "After Nakajima's faction voluntarily withdrew from the Rikken Seiyukai, it was impossible to expect any other outcome to the election of the party president than the long-awaited victory of Ichira Hatoyama, as his faction became dominant. Fusanosuke Kuhara could have been a problem, but he failed to gather the necessary coalition around him, and Hatoyama made an important step that dramatically raised his position in the party - a proposal to change the collective leadership, which not only made Kuhara the interim president, but also Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa. During the vote for party president, they thanked Hatoyama and the latter won the required number of votes."
 NW_JAP.349.a: "Congratulations to the "heir apparent""
 NW_JAP.350.t: "Rikken Seiyukai Schism"
 NW_JAP.350.d: "It did not take long for the rest of the Seiyukai Party to respond - Hatoyama and Kuhara quickly organized an alternative meeting to which they invited all remaining party members. At the meeting, they condemned the actions of the reformist faction and announced the expulsion of Nakajima, Shimada and Yonezo for violating the party charter and arbitrarily seizing power in the party. In their place, Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa were appointed as acting presidents. The party leaders called their caucus the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai Party. Suzuki finally lost power and was left out, although it is worth noting that unlike the reformists immediately Hatoyama and Kuhara did not go to elect a new president. On the other hand, analysts speculate that this was due to their own ideological antagonism between each other and the "ad hoc alliance" assembled to oppose Nakajima."
 NW_JAP.350.a: "The collapse of the old party"
 NW_JAP.351.t: "Neutral Fraction"
 NW_JAP.351.d: "The collapse of the oldest parliamentary party, the Rikken Seiyukai, continues as the "neutral faction" headed by Tsuneo Kanemitsu, Masataka Ota, and Takeru Inukai announced today that it has split from the other two factions. The latter is the son of Tsuyoshi Inukai Tsuyoshi, prime minister of the Seiyukai Inukai, who was assassinated by the military in 1932, but despite this, Tsuneo Kanemitsu, a major bureaucrat and manager of several corporations, is the leader of this group. Their ideological views are rather close to Hatoyama's faction, but they do not support his tactical alliance with Kuhara, a man who has sullied his reputation as the "financial backer of the February 26 putschists". On the other hand, Ota and Inukai are acquaintances of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. But it's worth remembering that the entire "neutral faction" is much smaller than either of the other two Seiyukai factions, precluding the possibility of any strong influence on the political process. And yet, despite this, the main thing that unites the "neutrals" - is the desire to reunify the Rikken Seiyukai, as they told reporters at a press conference."
 NW_JAP.351.a: "Given their numbers, it's a logical endeavor"
 NW_JAP.383.t: "Kuhara Heads the Orthodox Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.383.d: "The Rikken Seiyukai Party continues to maintain its frontrunner position in the headlines of recent months. The orthodox part of the party held elections for a new president after Kisaburo Suzuki resigned. No comment could be obtained from him on the split in the party as he has been in poor physical condition lately and refuses to give any interviews.\n\nFusanosuke Kuhara became the new president of the Seiyukai - on the wave of public sentiment he managed to collect more votes than his main opponent, Hatoyama. Despite his position as "Suzuki's heir", Hatoyama's faction was too small within the party. It was also partly influenced by the emergence of the Seiyukai "neutral faction", which Hatoyama is said to have counted on because of their similar ideological views. Other analysts say that Kuhara was chosen as a "mediator" between the two camps of Nakajima and Hatoyama, but it is likely to be of no avail and the party will not be reunited - its leaders are not going to back down."
 NW_JAP.383.a: "Let's see what Kuhara does in his position"
 NW_JAP.353.t: "Hatoyama Heads the Orthodox Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.353.d: "The Rikken Seiyukai Party continues to maintain its frontrunner position in the headlines of recent months. The orthodox part of the party held elections for a new president after Kisaburo Suzuki resigned. No comment could be obtained from him on the split in the party as he has been in poor physical condition lately and refuses to give any interviews.\n\nThe new Seiyukai president was Ichiro Hatoyama - Suzuki's heir finally managed to subdue at least the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai faction. This was especially unexpected against the backdrop of the well-known ideological confrontation between "tactical allies" Hatoyama and Kuhara - the latter turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician, thus confirming his financial assistance to the February 26 coup plotters. However, Hatoyama needs to proceed with caution, as Kuhara, with his connections, continues to be a dangerous rival."
 NW_JAP.353.a: "Such a fierce struggle will turn Hatoyama into a giant of politics"
 NW_JAP.354.t: "Extraordinary meeting of the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.354.d: "The newly appointed leader of the Rikken Seiyukai orthodox faction called an extraordinary general meeting of the party, at which he announced the "Six Basic Policies". Kuhara's expectations were fully confirmed - he envisages the Seiyukai being dissolved so that its example will be followed by other parliamentary parties, and to reaffirm national unity, he advocated a "National Council". Thus he too preaches the "one country, one party" theory. After the Rikken Seiyukai meeting, Kuhara convened a coalition of former members of both houses of parliament and leaders of all branches in Tokyo's Shiba Park and proposed the dissolution of the Rikken Seiyukai Party. Kuhara also met with Fumimaro Konoe and reported in the newspaper."
 NW_JAP.354.a: "The idea of an alliance with Kuhara was a mistake - he's even more radical than Nakajima"
 NW_JAP.355.t: "Unsuccessful Negotiations Between Seiyukai and Minseito"
 NW_JAP.355.d: "Today's newspaper headlines once again intrigued everyone with another rumor - Ichiro Hatoyama took the desperate step of holding talks with Rikken Minseito's leader, Machida Chuji, about possibly uniting the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai faction with the Minseito Party to counter the ideas of Fusanosuke Kuhara, who had become president of his party. Apparently realizing that cooperating with Kuhara was a mistake, he decided to take this action. However, these futile attempts were a failure - Kuhara's influence and connections in the political world of Japan are so great that he managed to thwart Hatoyamu and Chuji's plan. Talk that very quickly after forming their alliance, Hatoyama and Kuhara realized that they could not work together has been going around for a long time. Perhaps to Hatoyama's surprise, his "anti-Nakajima ally" turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician than Nakajima himself."
 NW_JAP.355.a: "Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer"
 NW_JAP.356.t: "New President Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.356.d: "Since 1935, one of the main parliamentary parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, has been in a state of permanent crisis. First, a group of deputies broke away from the party to form the Shōwakai Party in protest of the Seiyukai's policies toward the then cabinet, and the 1936 parliamentary elections dealt a fatal blow to the party's leader, Kisaburo Suzuki. The near defeat in the election and the victory of their main rivals, the Rikken Minseito, with small parties growing in the background destroyed Suzuki's reputation within the party, and also undermined his morale and later his physical condition. It was only through the efforts of his relative, Ichiro Hatoyama, that he managed to win a seat in the House of Peers and retain influence in the party for a while longer. Today, however, amid his deteriorating health, Suzuki announced that he would step down as party president and that Hatoyama, his protégé and one of the party's top functionaries, would take his place. Despite his some of his actions in his early 30s, he is currently considered the leader of the party's "anti-war faction"."
 NW_JAP.356.a: "Democracy is paying off"
 NW_JAP.357.t: "Intra-party Criticism of Hatoyama"
 NW_JAP.357.d: "After another failure of the Rikken Seiyukai in the parliamentary elections, the majority of the party has developed grievances against the party leadership, especially Hatoyama, who is now perceived as "the failed successor of the equally failed Suzuki" - their reputation ruined by successive failures in competition with other parties.In addition, they are also credited with the Shōwakai breakaway following the failed policy of opposing the cabinet.Hatoyama tried to fend off this criticism, realizing that behind it were his longtime rival Chikuhei Nakajima and his pro-war faction, as well as perhaps the army leaders themselves, who found in Nakajima a last chance to gain power by legal means."
 NW_JAP.357.a: "Hatoyama is really failing"
 NW_JAP.358.t: "Hatoyama Resigns"
 NW_JAP.358.d: "The storm of resentment against Hatoyama continued to grow as articles criticizing the Suzuki-Hatoyama leadership began to be published in party journals and newspapers. Soon enough, the party debate turned into a threat to withdraw the majority of party members if Hatoyama did not resign from his post. So far, however, there have been no statements from his side. Discussions began about the possible formation of a new party, but soon everything was resolved - Hatoyama called an extraordinary meeting of the party, where he announced his resignation and, accordingly, the election of the party president. They were held quickly and with an obvious outcome - the winner was Nakajima, who will obviously now begin the final restructuring of the party for himself and his pro-war faction."
 NW_JAP.358.a: "That's sad"
 NW_JAP.359.t: "Strengthening the pro-war agitation of Rikken Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.359.d: "The Rikken Seiyukai Party, led by Chikuhei Nakajima, has decided to take the opposite stance against our party's claims of taking a strong anti-war stance, and to make the most of this issue. By promoting the old thesis about the independence of the Supreme Army Command, they are trying to win the trust of the voters and, most importantly, to gain support among the military to pressure us through them and other elite groups."
 NW_JAP.359.a: "Once again Nakajima has proven himself to be a puppet of the military"
 NW_JAP.360.t: "Kuhara's on Top"
 NW_JAP.360.d: "After much turmoil and what appeared to be the complete destruction of the Rikken Seiyukai Party, its leader, Fusanosuke Kuhara, who unexpectedly ascended to office, managed to lead it to victory, which confirmed his claim to the post. And while for party members this means a warm seat in the new cabinet, for the rest of us it means the restoration or rather the establishment of a pause, a silence. Silence before the thunder - because everyone has already heard about Kuhara's ties to the February 26 conspirators, and is also well aware, thanks to Kuhara himself, of his positions and the ideology that now dominates within the party."
 NW_JAP.360.a: "Will Kuhara dare to realize a one-party movement?"
 NW_JAP.361.t: "Rikken Seiyukai has Regained the Lead"
 NW_JAP.361.d: "After a long and unsuccessful period of Kisaburo-Hatoyama's rule, during which Rikken Seiyukai lost her position in parliament and was never able to lead the cabinet, she has now managed to do so under the leadership of Chikuhei Nakajima. This raises Nakajima's own reputation within the party to an even higher level, confirming that his faction has taken the ruling position for a reason. Along with this, however, come concerns due to the fact that the Seiyukai leader has long been known as a supporter of army officers and their ideologies."
 NW_JAP.361.a: "The Army men have again found an advocate for their interests"
 NW_JAP.362.t: "Seiyukai Dominates the Parliament"
 NW_JAP.362.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama has finally been able to prove that he is a good leader and not just a protege of the previous, unsuccessful Suzuki Party president. This victory in the parliamentary elections and the post of prime minister will fully enhance his reputation and allow him to realize the new political ideals he has developed over the past years in the course of intra-party confrontations."
 NW_JAP.362.a: "A stable Seiyukai is the key to the formation of a democratic system"
 NW_JAP.363.t: "Hatoyama Led the Rikken Seiyukai to Victory"
 NW_JAP.363.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama was able to unite at least the entire orthodox part of the Rikken Seiyukai Party under his control and lead it to victory in the parliamentary elections. This was an important goal for him, as it could help him against the now rival Reformist Seiyukai Party under the leadership of Chikuhei Nakajima, not a faction. In essence, this means that Hatoyama was right in the dispute between them, and now the number of questions for Nakajima, who destroyed the party, will increase dramatically."
 NW_JAP.363.a: "It is possible that this is the first step towards rebuilding the Seiyukai"
 NW_JAP.364.t: "Konoe Forms a Government"
 NW_JAP.364.d: "Prince Konoe's agreement to take over the Kakushin Shinto party was an unexpected decision on his part, as he had long refused to get involved in the political wrangling of the lower house of parliament because of his background and his seat in the House of Peers. However, having apparently realized the mood of the public and where the country was heading, the shrewd and sensitive Konoe decided to take this step in order to achieve his main goal of sitting in the prime minister's chair. Given his own ideological preferences, as well as those of his co-partisans, however, we should now expect a strong change in the political structure of the state."
 NW_JAP.364.a: "Seems like he's got it going on"
 NW_JAP.365.t: "Kakushin Shinto Forms a Government"
 NW_JAP.365.d: "Kakushin Shinto has proven to be much more resilient than initially thought. It has already survived many severe crises, but overall the idea of constant merger and cooperation of political parties in our country is still relevant - after all, its predecessor, Shakai Taishuto, was also a merger of several other parties initially. Now Kakushin Shinto has already won the election and will have to form a government."

It wins the next general election to the Diet, keeping party leader Machida Chuji in a position to form a government. To some extent, such successes contradict its ideology, as it assumes the formation of a stable two-party system, which has not yet been observed.

Having become interested in religion at the end of the 19th century, he quickly became disillusioned with its overly "peaceful" forms and decided to develop his own doctrine, which eventually turned into Nichirenism, a fusion of the nationalist doctrine of Kokuchukai and Buddhism. His ideas were followed by such famous people as Nisho Inoue and Kanji Ishiwara, and even Ikki Kita came under his influence. Supporters of Nichirenism at the moment are already tens of thousands of people throughout Asia. His son, Satomi Kishio, will take over the leadership of Kokuchukai."

 NW_JAP.372.d: "After the death of General Secretary Shakai Taishuto Hisashi Aso, who also headed the National Socialist faction of the party, the latter began to lose strength. Inejiro Asanuma, who was close to him, was so shattered by the grief of the early loss of his comrade that he became depressed and rarely appeared at party meetings. Kenichiro Kamei, left virtually alone, was unable to fully replace them both.

There had been rumors as to why he did this and why he would stand up for them at all, but the answer was recently revealed that because of his plans for the New System Movement, Konoe had become fearful of a possible assassination attempt by the military, as Konoe's entourage and himself had now realized that powerful military leaders were the main threat to Japan and its future, their unchecked actions in China and other war zones making the civilian government a scapegoat every time.  To prevent this, he has decided to hire as his bodyguards people who would clearly hate those who would try to assassinate the prince - they are old ideological opponents of the currently dominant top army officers. Besides - they are just very good marksmen, since they managed to kill several people during their political terrorist attack."

They are members of the so-called "god-sent troops," or more specifically, Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto's Japan Youth Party. This formidable organization, rumored to number as many as 100 000 ardent soldiers, was almost like the Colonel's personal army. Its flag, a white sun against a red balloon, symbolized "bloody patriotism under a red-hot sun." Her commander boasted, "Look at me - I'm not a man who can sit back and talk." However, for the past few months, Kingoro Hashimoto seemed to have disappeared from public life, but in fact he has been weaving a web of conspiracy against the current cabinet like a spider. He trusted the idea of Prince Fumimaro Konoe and was one of the most zealous agitators for the dissolution of the old political parties. Apparently, this moral pressure on the prime minister to give up his post to Konoe was the main purpose of Hashimoto's plot. By arresting not only the rank-and-file members of the conspiracy, but also the Colonel himself, we will finally be able to deal with the New System Movement, which has been testing our government in recent months."

He is currently living with his wife in the Dojunkai Apartments in Tokyo, modern reinforced concrete buildings built after the Great Earthquake of 1923 for the victims and the needy, and a group of several men came in and rang the doorbell, and when Abe opened it, they hit him between the eyes with a cane with such force that the elderly politician fell to the floor. His wife, hearing something incomprehensible, immediately rushed into the corridor, from where the criminals had already left. Although the injury was not serious, Abe was lucky that his daughter and her husband, physician Tisato Maruyama, live in the same building.\n\nIn response to the attack on their leader, an emergency delegate meeting was held at the Socialist Mass Party headquarters, where it was decided that each faction would be called upon to submit "a resolution of censure regarding the maintenance of public order in the imperial capital". In addition, an opinion calling for the dismissal of Interior Minister Nobumasa Suetsugu was also expressed. Shakai Taishuto MP Jotaro Kawakami has already raised an urgent question in the House plenary and held the minister responsible. Suetsugu responded, "We will take decisive action.

His security was beefed up and it is possible that the assassination attempt was thus prevented.

It was a group of juvenile ultranationalists who acted on the orders of their leader Toichi Mannen - they turned him in without delay during interrogation.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the reason for their attack was that the leaders of Shakai Taishuto had not abandoned their ideas of establishing socialism in the country at such a crucial historical moment, but on the contrary, they wanted to take advantage of the situation to advance their goal."

 NW_JAP.378.d: "The Meiji Constitution contains no legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing the prime minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the "general ruler of the government", was to exercise the right of appointment at will, unconstrained by legal provisions or the wishes of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved by having the emperor's nine unofficial advisors, the genro, advise him on who to appoint as head of the cabinet, and the monarch "accepts" their nomination.However, this solution could not be permanent due to the natural aging and death of the advisors. By the end of the Taisho period, only the great Kimmochi Saionji was alive. From this period onward, the emperors raised the question of a new procedure for appointing the prime minister. Now the time has come for the urgent need to choose one. Among the options under consideration, offered by various of the emperor's inner circle, are the following:\n\n1. Consultation with the Privy Council;\n2. Consultation with senior ministers;\n3.\n\nThe first involves strengthening the powers of the Privy Council, an institutional law-making body under the emperor that advises him on various matters of state. The second involves replacing the genro with a group of people with experience in public service in various government positions, such as former prime ministers. The third, however, proposes a mixture of consultations with the Privy Council and former prime ministers - it is promoted by Koichi Kido, Konoe's closest aide and, like him, a representative of a group of "young aristocrats"."

In it he described the terrible atrocities committed by the Japanese against both civilians and prisoners of war. As an example, he cited an incident that shocked him when an officer told him that the best way to train recruits was to use live Chinese POWs for bayonet practice "because it gives you willpower". He also said that he had been shown army films showing Japanese soldiers gassing Chinese prisoners tied to stakes and attaching bacteriological bombs to planes preparing to bomb Chinese cities.

Teruo is an adopted son in an old samurai family and is expected to marry Mitsuko, the eldest daughter. However, Teruo has become infected with the idea of Western individualism during his time in Western Europe and refuses to submit to the demands of society. Instead, he confuses his future father-in-law, Yamato Iwao, by announcing that he intends to marry Gerda Storm, a German journalist he met on a ship returning to Japan. Gerda, however, is a blonde, chaste, Aryan woman, and she will not settle for a mixed-race relationship. She tries to convince him of his duty to the Japanese race and traditions and reconcile him with his family. Meanwhile, Mitsuko, feeling humiliated by Teruo's rejection, attempts suicide by throwing herself into a volcano. At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple are romantically reunited.At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple is romantically reunited. A short while later, the young couple and their child now live in Manchukuo-Go, "New Earth", working on a farm under the benevolent gaze of a vigilant soldier protecting them from the omnipresent threat of Bolshevism.\n\nThe film brought together an all-star cast of Japanese cinema: Mitsuko is played by the young diva Setsuko Hara, and she would travel to Germany on a tour to premiere the film. The film had two directors, Arnold Funk and Mansaku Itami, which eventually led to two versions of the film, each for its own country. Critics received the movie poorly in our country - they saw it as a condescending treatment of Japan as an exotic eastern nation that needs German political ideas as if it had none of its own. Also, many critics noted the racist ideology of "Blood and Soil", which they found disturbing. However, everyone appreciated Setsuko Hara's performance - she has now gained national and possibly worldwide fame."

 NW_JAP.385.t: "Death of Gondo Seikyo"
 NW_JAP.385.d: "One of the leaders and ideologues of the Nohonsugi agrarian movement died today. Until the very last days of his life, he had a clear mind and, as he continued to follow the news, he commented on certain actions of the national government. For example, he criticized the projects of nationalization of electricity activities as another encroachment of the state and its interference in private life. He also criticized the military for constant incidents on the border with China, which could be too dangerous and lead to a real confrontation."
 NW_JAP.385.a: "Now only Tachibana is left of Nohonsugi's ideologues"
 NW_JAP.386.t: "Masaki's return"
 NW_JAP.386.d: "After the death of Gondo Seikyo, Nohonsugi's ideologue and prime minister, the question of who would become the country's next prime minister arose, as the leader of the agrarian movement had left no clear heir and died unexpectedly. General Masaki, who had long been looking for an opportunity to return to such a high position, took advantage of the confusion. Having once again reminded himself of the radicality of the young officers and the fact that only he could control them, he secured his reappointment as prime minister, despite the hatred of a large number of top government officials."
 NW_JAP.386.a: "He walks on thin ice"
 NW_JAP.384.t: "Ugaki's leaving"
 NW_JAP.384.d: "Prime Minister Kazushige Ugaki, who prepared and led the country through the worst war in human history, has decided to step down. His rule will be remembered for getting rid of political instability and uncontrolled military, as well as winning the war. In addition, Ugaki showed himself a good and intelligent general, who in time realized the need to modernize the army, as well as the use of the most modern means of warfare and rallying the nation.\n\nNow it is necessary to choose a new leader of the government of the Empire. Many people are tired of the military as prime minister, and despite all the merits of the army in the past war, they want to see a man from outside the army as prime minister. This could be diplomat Hirota Koki, who has already been in this position and has some experience in government.[JAP_get_event_384_desc]"

 NW_JAP.388.t: "Jewish Mentality"
 NW_JAP.388.d: "In his struggle against the growing monopoly of power by top civil and military officials and privileged capital, Seigo Nakano even adapted the theme of anti-Semitism to the Japanese political scene. Recalling Hitler's claim that Germany's defeat in the Great War was due to Jewish domination of finance and administration in collusion with the bureaucracy, he drew an analogy to the control of Japan's wartime economy by bureaucrats and their capitalist accomplices in state-supported economic agencies. It was the people, he insisted, who really had the "Jewish mentality", not the people sometimes accused by the new bureaucrats, the independently thinking industrialists, who resisted the dead hand of bureaucratic control and were the ones who were really capable of effectively managing Japan's crisis economy."
 NW_JAP.388.a: "It seems that imitating the Nazis is crossing the line"
 NW_JAP.389.t: "Attacks on Nakano"
 NW_JAP.389.d: "Various political forces, whether traditional Japanese, or liberals and leftists, equally branded Nakano as nothing less than a "fascist".The term had already entered Japanese usage as a pejorative, in the sense of "overbearing" or "willful".Once, when he heard this epithet used against him, and feeling that it was hardly appropriate, he asked his sons if they thought he was a fascist. However, Nakano himself used it sometimes almost as a pejorative, for example, when responding to an accusation of "fascism", he claimed that it was in fact the "new bureaucrats'" who had actually led the country into "professional bureaucratic fascism". The term first became widely used against him because of his confrontation with Rikken Minseito MP Saito Takao, who is known as a critic of military intervention in politics."
 NW_JAP.389.a: "Son, am I a... fascist?"
 NW_JAP.390.t: "Nakano's Speech in Parliament"
 NW_JAP.390.d: "The leader of the newly formed Tohokai Party, Seigo Nakano, made another high-profile speech in parliament. In it, he unexpectedly attacked the Japanists, the right-wing conservative advocates of Japan's own way. He disparaged them as people who, in practice, were inclined to support the monopoly of the current government.\n\n-They are no longer able to fulfill the hopes of the nation! - They look to mysticism as an outlet for their inadequate arguments and try to convey incomprehensible aspects of this mysticism through classical works that cannot be explained in modern language. Nothing of this kind can satisfy the national sentiments of modern Japan. Although, these right-wingers are called "fascists" by liberals, it must be recognized that Hitler's movement is not a reactionary-revolutionary movement isolated from national feeling as is seen in our "pure Japanists"."
 NW_JAP.390.a: "A reactionary and revolutionary movement...?"
 NW_JAP.391.t: "Tohokai General Conference"
 NW_JAP.391.d: "The Tohokai Party held a general conference the other day at which it called for a vigorous continuation of the campaign in China to prevent the development of a situation similar to that seen during the Spanish Civil War. In an article warning of this possibility, its leader, Seigo Nakano rejected Chiang Kaishi's prediction from their interview in early 1936 about the consequences of a long-term conflict between Japan and China, denying that the Kuomintang could rally the Chinese people to sustain a resistance similar to that of the Spartans to Persia or Japan to the Mongols because it was a mere puppet of "forces alien to China" and a purely regional power based on the comprador community of the Lower Yangtze."
 NW_JAP.391.a: "Let's see whose point of view is correct"
 NW_JAP.392.t: "Nakano's Trip"
 NW_JAP.392.d: "Seigo Nakano, leader of the Tohokai parliamentary party, said that in the current foreign policy environment, Japan has no choice but to seek an alliance with the Axis countries, as China has fallen under the sway of puppet forces supported collectively by the Soviet Union and the United States. Accordingly, he decided to visit the leaders of the Axis countries as a "national envoy", as opposed to the usual diplomats representing the supporters of the status quo line of foreign policy. To present him with the appropriate credentials, Tohokai held a mass rally on November 11, 1937, attended by, among other publicly known personalities, the "Three Great Elders": Miyake, Toyama, and Tokutomi So, owners of major national newspapers. The rally was followed by a procession of 3000 supporters carrying flags of the Axis countries and large lanterns bearing the party's name, past the Imperial Palace to the Tokyo train station. Further rallies were held in other cities further west along the Nakano route."

 NW_JAP_news.54.d: "Seigo Nakano, leader of the Japanese fascist movement, arrived in Rome. He conducted an interview with Mussolini and his foreign minister, Count Ciano. Nakano said that the Japanese people would never allow the government to compromise on China, and added that while the Manchurian Incident, the assassination of prime ministers, and the February uprising might look like the onset of chaos, each of these episodes had improved the situation in Japan. After an hour-long interview, Mussolini authorized Nakano to convey his willingness to enter into a comprehensive alliance with Japan and asked him to record an address to Japanese youth that read, "March straight ahead - straight ahead! If you encounter obstacles, keep marching straight ahead!" Nakano used this phrase as the title of his article about the trip."
 NW_JAP_news.54.a: "A promising meeting"
 NW_JAP_news.55.t: "[GetNewsHeadline] Seigo Nakano in Berlin"
 NW_JAP_news.55.d: "Through the mediation of the strongly pro-German Japanese military attaché Oshima, the leader of the Japanese fascist movement, Seigo Nakano, managed to meet with Foreign Minister Baron Neurath and other leading Nazis and finally with Hitler himself. Here too, the Japanese Embassy tried to limit the time of the interview, but Hitler extended it to 50 minutes. During their conversation, Hitler denied any territorial claims in East Asia, hoping only for trade opportunities, the main obstacle to which was the Comintern. He hoped Japan would solve the problem, but hoped the war would not be too debilitating. To this, Nakano assured him that the real battle was already over. The Kuomintang was now just a regional force. Nakano later described Hitler as much more cautious and deliberative in his discussions than Mussolini, who always had ready answers."
 NW_JAP_news.55.a: "Honest conversation"
 NW_JAP.393.t: "Trip Results"
 NW_JAP.393.d: "Returning to Japan, after personally reporting to Prince Konoe, who had given him a secret letter to the Axis leaders before his trip, Nakano addressed Army and Navy staff meetings at which he not only advocated a military alliance with the Axis, but insisted on the capture of Canton as a last resort to isolate the Kuomintang in order to challenge Britain. Kanji Ishiwara, who attended the meetings, lamented the callousness of the staff officers who quietly listened as Nakano "shamelessly expounded his amateurish strategy". It's worth remembering that Ishiwara was the center of resistance to launching a full-scale war with China in the army. And apparently despite their earlier close relationship (Ishiwara was Nakano's military advisor), they are now distancing themselves from each other."
 NW_JAP.393.a: "Surely the idea of an alliance with Germany must have greatly pleased other army officers"
 NW_JAP.394.t: "Nakano in the spotlight"
 NW_JAP.394.d: "Seigo Nakano's visit to the European fascist powers was accompanied by a major media campaign. A handout prepared by his diplomatic advisor Nakayama Masaru for distribution during his visit described Nakano as the central figure of the "renewal movement", Japan's greatest orator, a true Japanese in his faults and virtues, an economist of the Friedrich List school (whom he had studied at Waseda University and sometimes quoted, though not as a central authority), and a Confucian idealist, strengthened by personal tragedy and now living "the stoic life of a Zen monk".\n\nThe image he himself tried to project was definitely reminiscent of his assessment of Hitler, whom he described as a mere "patriot" from the lower strata of German society, whom he was for that reason "honored to represent". Similarly, "it is to our Tohokai that the privilege of leading our society has been entrusted". He regarded Hitler's loyalty as demonstrated by his celibacy and vegetarianism, just as Mussolini abstained from alcohol and tobacco."
 NW_JAP.394.a: "I visited European countries. The leaders there - well, literally me"
 NW_JAP.395.t: "Eastern Youth Corps"
 NW_JAP.395.d: "Upon his return from Europe, he focused on building a mass movement modeled on the Nazi Party as he envisioned it, based on a youth movement called the Eastern Youth Corps from late 1938 onwards. Its members wore a uniform consisting of a black field cap, a dark blue shirt, a dark red tie, and an armband depicting a swastika based on the initial character "Tohokai", meaning "East".\n\nNakano's own appearance changed so noticeably that an old friend of Ogata's commented, "His black fascist uniform, the emblem resembling a Nazi swastika on his armband, and his trips to Europe all make me think he's lost his mind". Despite these and other derisive comments, Nakano continued to wear the uniform and participate in rallies across the country."

From now on, the law gives the government full power to control people's daily lives and general business activities. Under the law, the Sejm will be effectively stripped of its functions.Small parties and some independent MPs actively supported the bill. The two dominant groups of lawmakers on whom the fate of the law depended, Rikken Minseito and Rikken Seiyukai, initially voiced strong opposition to the bill, saying it violated the Constitution.

 NW_JAP.396.t: "Agrarian expansionism in Manchuria"
 NW_JAP.396.d: "The main ideologue of "agrarian expansionism" was Kato Kanji, an educator and agriculturist who has been running his own agricultural school for farmers and possible settlers in Manchuria for several years. He has his own coherent belief system, which assumes that the farmers will cultivate the land they receive on their own, thus returning to the "original Yamato spirit", purge internal moral issues, and become a solid support for the imperial throne. In addition, he suggests that they will abandon modern capitalist mechanization of labor and return to manual farming. Also, Kato believes that this is where the true spirit of "soldier-farmers" will be realized, as he believes that settlers should be armed with light small arms and be ready to defend their newly acquired land.\n\nHe is also assisted in this by Colonel Togu Tetsuo of the Kwantung Army, who is also interested in colonizing Manchuria, as this will make it easier to control all of Manchukuo-Go's lands and will be a powerful weapon in the future war with the Soviet Union - for this purpose the settlers are given plots of land along the border with the USSR. Togu suggests that when the war begins, Japanese farmers will be able to help the Kwantung Army with food supplies and fight guerrillas infiltrating across the border. It is worth noting, however, that Kato did not envision his settlers cooperating with the Kwantung Army, but in the end did not refuse the colonel's help."
 NW_JAP.396.a: "Interesting concepts"
 NW_JAP.397.t: "Kato's dissatisfaction with the colonization of Manchuria"
 NW_JAP.397.d: "Kato and his supporters were disappointed when the settlers in Manchuria turned out to be landowners rather than altruistic farmers and preferred modern farming methods. Instead of improving national fortunes and morals, they sought security and a comfortable life. This included hiring Chinese as laborers on their land holdings. This reality led Kato to cut back on recruiting adult settlers and instead focus on adolescents, who would presumably be young people with high goals. To this end, he convinced the Ministry of Agriculture to create a Youth Volunteer Corps for Manchurian development and personally train them in "Yamatobataraki" ("working for the Yamato")."
 NW_JAP.397.a: "On the other hand, the army is interested in recruiting young men into its ranks"
 NW_JAP.398.t: "Anti-Bolshevik Bloc Proposal"
 NW_JAP.398.d: "Through secret channels, the government of the Empire of Japan proposed to us the idea of an alliance against the Soviet Union in order to overthrow the Bolshevik power in that country. Long ago we promised this to the White forces during the Russian Civil War, but at that time it seemed to us that the Bolshevik power could not last five years without invasion, but now we can clearly say that totalitarian regimes are much more dangerous than we thought in the early 20s. In any case, since we do not have a border with the USSR, Japan will take the main blow, and we will only support it in this confrontation at sea, in the air and with arms, and most importantly - it will distract Japan for a long time from attempts to seize our Asian possessions."

 NW_JAP.401.t: "Turanist Union"
 NW_JAP.401.d: "The Japanese government in recent years has taken the concept of the Turanian origin of the Japanese people seriously and has decided to adopt it as a fundamental part of its policy. It thus reinforces the long-standing aspirations of the Japanese for Siberia and the liberation of these lands from the Bolsheviks and Russians. In line with this, they also wish to expand ties with us, and several other countries on the border with the USSR, as parts of the larger Turanian world. The final goal of this rapprochement should be a common alliance against the USSR for the liberation of the Turanian peoples from the clutches of Bolshevism and the Slavs."

 NW_JAP.423.d: "Events in our capital began to unfold with incredible speed. When the Japanese garrison commander ordered the disarmament of the Kuomintang troops, the latter, despite their small numbers, gave battle to a superior garrison of East Hebei troops. Sandwiched between the city wall and the Japanese army, they continued their suicide mission. The East Hebei divisions, manned by ethnic Chinese, were inspired by this feat, and they defected to the resisting side. It was the perfect time to cross over to the rebel side."

A detachment from Song Zheyuan's army came to the city walls of Tongzhou, after which a battle broke out between him and our troops. Unexpectedly, the divisions of the army of East Hebei, staffed by Chinese, came to the side of the Chinese, as a result of which our loyal units were defeated and almost completely killed. Only a few dozen soldiers and 60 civilians of the city who were living there in our concession managed to escape from Tongzhou. They report the horrors that took place in the city after the Chinese soldiers took possession of it. Most of the women were raped and killed in perverted ways. Men were brutally murdered and dismembered."

The Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] had already forwarded a message to the Emperor that he was taking responsibility for what had happened and wished to resign. The emperor's entourage felt it was the right thing for the prime minister to do, as it takes the shadow of shame away from the emperor. In such an unstable environment, the Emperor's uncle, Prince Naruhiko, volunteered to form a temporary emergency government, as the situation in the country had reached a breaking point - for many decades Japan had not faced such a situation when its army suffered a terrible defeat, and since it had great influence in pre-war politics, it would now shake up the entire state system."

Thus, the Shakai Taishuto became the Socialist Party of Japan. The Rikken Seiyukai changed its name to the Liberal Party of Japan, and the Rikken Minseito to the Progressive Party of Japan.

That night Konoe and his son spoke at length about the past war and the heavy responsibility he felt to the emperor and the Japanese people. Fumimaro wrote down in pencil his feelings on these matters at his son's insistence.\n\nThen they sat in silence until Michitaka told his father to go to bed and asked if he was going to leave tomorrow. Fumimaro didn't answer, and they stared at each other in silence. Michitaka had never seen such a strange and unpleasant expression on his father's face and for the first time he sensed his intention to die.\n\nShortly before dawn, Michitaka was awakened by his mother's excited voice.When he entered his father's room, Fumimaro was stretched out and looked as calm and serene as if he were asleep. An empty brownish bottle lay next to his pillow. He had committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide."

The politicians and some generals were being investigated for their participation in launching wars of conquest, and most of the officers were being investigated for the commission of war crimes by their subordinates in the conquered territories. During this time, each of them was investigated individually, taking into account the available material and the interrogation of witnesses, as well as their own cross-examinations. In the end, the main unifying feature of all those arrested was the words about the "innocence of the emperor". It is up to us to decide what punishment to mete out to these men."

 NW_JAP.433.d: "Japan needs a new constitution because the old one has allowed radical forces to come to power in the country. It is quite clear that the parliament will be the center of the new political system of the country, but the most important question we need to decide is whether to keep the monarchy in the country or not.\n\nOn the one hand, the members of the imperial house are tainted by their involvement in war crimes, and the monarch himself did not stop his subordinates when necessary. On the other hand, many analysts and experts on Japan believe that the emperor could not have done so, so it is difficult to blame him for starting the war. Moreover, there are fears that abandoning the monarchy would turn the vast majority of the country's population against us and threaten to start a civil war, since the Japanese are very loyal to their emperor and the dynasty that has ruled the country for more than 2000 years.\n\nWe should also consider a constitution proposed by the Japanese politicians themselves from the current government. These politicians are trustworthy, as they ruled the country during the Taisho democracy, but their draft of the main document of the country is almost a complete copy of the old Meiji constitution with some cosmetic changes and lack of such a strong influence of the military."

The monarch retains purely ceremonial powers, moreover, he can no longer even make political statements, so as not to provoke anything more like the political conspiracies of the 30s.\n\nAlso today, under the new constitution, the first elections for the National Parliament were held.

 NW_JAP.444.t: "Four Handshakes"
 NW_JAP.444.d: "Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi is one of the main ideologists of the Pan-European Union in the world, but few people know that he was born into a mixed family of the Austro-Hungarian chargé d'affaires in Japan, Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and a Japanese woman, Mitsuko Aoyama, the daughter of a large merchant. It is possible that it was this connection with Japan that saved the life of the young contemporary philosopher. Since the late 1920s, Kalergi had been in conflict with the NSDAP and Adolf Hitler in absentia, and after their rise to power, this became a direct threat to his life. In 1938 he published his last book, The Totalitarian State Against Man, after which he had to change country after country, hiding from persecution. Eventually, he was able to find asylum in Lisbon and then leave for the United States thanks to the Japanese ambassador, with whom he developed a good relationship. As a parting gift, the Count left the Ambassador a signed copy of this book. The ambassador, in turn, lent the book to the international journalist Shigeharu Matsumoto, who in turn lent it to the political scientist Asaso Ichimura of Waseda University. As a person close to Ichira Hatoyama, he gave the book to the prime minister, asking him to translate it into Japanese for wide distribution. Hatoyama was so taken by the ideas described in the book that he inquired about his fate and decided to establish a "Yuai" or "Brotherhood" in the country."
 NW_JAP.444.a: "Who's Yuai?"
 NW_JAP.445.t: "Brotherhood"
 NW_JAP.445.d: "The goal of the "Brotherhood" ("Yuai"), based on the Kudenhove-Kalergi philosophy, is to create a kinder world through motherly love. This theory includes mutual respect, mutual understanding, mutual aid, humanism, individualism, cooperation, chivalry, bushido, and building human relationships as if everyone is "ladies and gentlemen". The three principles of brotherhood are the philosophy of the fraternal movement: mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual aid (or mutual cooperation) based on the dignity of individuality. In addition, Hatoyama is known to have recently joined a Masonic lodge in Tokyo.\n\nThe move to create the Yuai suggests that Hatoyama not only liked the European philosopher's ideas, but also the prime minister's personal problems. In the early 1930s, as a cabinet member and protégé of Kisaburo Suzuki, he dealt a severe blow to the reputation of democratic parties and the idea of party cabinets, which indirectly helped the military to disintegrate for a time and nearly seize power in the country. Hatoyama was also directly to blame for the curtailment of academic freedom of speech when he forced the dismissal of a left-wing professor from Kyoto Imperial University in 1933.  Soon enough he realized what all these actions had brought the country to, and from that point on he began trying to repair the political system from the wounds he himself had had a hand in.\n\nThis was the task that drove Hatoyama all along - atoning for his own sin and restoring his reputation. It was for this reason that Kudenhove-Kalergi's book struck at the Prime Minister's heart and won his trust. And today he seems to be able to relax - he has succeeded in fulfilling the goal he set for himself."

 NW_JAP.473.d: "Когда план Аюкавы в отношении промышленного развития Маньчжоу-Го только начал реализовываться, ходили слухи, что отставка Мацуоки была неизбежна. Однако Мацуока оказался гораздо более стойким. Он задержался дольше, чем кто-либо ожидал, наблюдая за реорганизацией своего исследовательского подразделения и добиваясь того, чтобы его вице-президент Омура Такуичи стал президентом. Лишь только сегодня он подал в отставку. Газеты сообщили о переменах в руководстве Южно-Маньчжурской железной дороги, но отнеслись к этому обыденно. Это резко отличалось от времени его назначения, когда это считалось одной из главных новостей. В наши дни ни Мацуока, ни Мантецу не заслуживали освещения на первых полосах газет. Времена изменились.\n\nГоды, проведенные в SMR, были хорошими и запоминающимися, потому что президентство Мацуоки позволяло ему сохранять иллюзию безграничных возможностей. Когда промышленное подразделение Южно-Маньчжурской железной дороги было передано в только что созданную Мангё, Мацуока решил создать новое Исследовательское подразделение. Его бурная деятельность - создание и реализация одного за другим новых проектов в Мантецу — скрывала сомнения в его собственных способностях и направлении на будущее.\n\nДаже это закончилось его отставкой. По возвращении в Токио он внезапно осознал, что у него больше нет должности. Возникло чувство полного одиночества и бессилия. Он по-прежнему был амбициозен, но все пути к власти были для него закрыты. Исследовательский отдел Мантецу продолжил снабжать его разведывательными отчетами, но они не были обнадеживающими. Его шансы стать следующим премьер-министром считаются нулевыми, а его шансы на пост министра иностранных дел - весьма незначительными. Он нажил себе слишком много политических врагов, а времена поменялись так, что никто и представить себе не мог."

 NW_JAP.474.d: "После своего триумфального возвращения из Женевы, где он вывел японскую делегацию с заседания Лиги Наций, на которой обсуждался вопрос захвата Маньчжурии, Мацуока задумался о переводе накопленного кредита доверия и популярности от массового населения в политическое влияние. Тогда он покинул ещё и парламент, сдав свой депутатский мандат, призвав к роспуску всех политических партий. Также он создал свой собственный Молодёжный корпус, численностью в несколько десятков тысяч человек по всей стране. Он начал поездки по стране с выступлениями и речами, его начали тайно поддерживать крупные финансовые игроки, а также некоторые издатели крупнейших газет, однако не дождавшись передачи ему поста премьер-министра и не решившись на решительные действия в духе Бенито Муссолини, на которого он ровнялся, Мацуока согласился занять пост президента Мантецу в середине 1935 года, распустив свои организации и движения.\n\nОднако, проиграв на полях Маньчжурии, он как недавно стало известно вернулся в Токио и на днях призвал Ота Коити возродить ту молодёжную организацию, которую он создал во время движения за роспуск политической партии. Как и прежде, этих молодых людей попросили подготовиться к служению стране в условиях чрезвычайного положения в стране и посещать специальные учебные занятия и лекции. Им была обещана сумма в 20 000 иен в месяц для найма лекторов и организации образовательных встреч для этих молодых людей. Молодежная организация сама по себе не могла обеспечить переход Мацуоки на новую политическую должность, как это уже однажды было доказано в 1935 году. Однако это давало ему определенную степень независимости в переговорах с другими политиками и военными. Некоторые члены молодежных групп, в основном из слоев ниже среднего и низшего класса и преимущественно из сельской местности, были связаны с группами правых. Это были те же группы, из которых офицеры среднего звена получали поддержку. Мацуока также поддерживал тесные контакты с такими людьми, как Тояма Мицуру, лидер всемогущего Общества реки Амур, чтобы обеспечить признание правых групп."

Паре разрешили всего три свидания, после чего Дзедзи должен был дать определённый ответ о своих намерениях. Мацуока искал в своем будущем зяте человека, который не пропадал бы дома, как он сам, и Дзедзи был именно таким человеком, которого он представлял для своей дочери. Дзедзи является аспирантом Токийского университета по французской литературе и не интересуется политикой.\n\nСвязь этого непримечательного бытового события с большой политикой кроется в том, что Мацуока после выхода из Лиги Наций обрёл огромную популярность в народе, но потерял какую-либо репутацию среди высших правящих кругов, что является критически важной вещью, если человек хочет занять пост премьер-министра. Масло в огонь этому подлили его связи с молодыми офицерами и офицерами среднего звена. Каждый раз, когда речь заходила о нём в контексте политики, все припоминали его поддержку союза с Германией и подобных радикальных идей.\n\nБлагодаря же этому браку эта проблема разрешилась. Семья жениха пользуется большим уважением в деловых и придворных кругах. Намеренно или нет, но свадьба дочери Мацуоки помогла ему снова завоевать расположение уже своих сверстников."

Он зафиксировал у него явное ухудшение здоровье. При этом он уже страдал от астмы и язвы желудка. Мацуоке был предписан отдых, но это роскошь, которую он не может себе позволить.\n\nВероятно, он мог бы делегировать часть своих задач подчинённым, но в сочетании с необходимостью сохранять секретность, «одинокий рейнджер» всегда чувствовал, что может выполнять свою работу намного лучше, чем его подчиненные. Таким образом, всё, чего сам Мацуока не может сделать, часто игнорируется. Его здоровье и его стиль одинокого рейнджера стали постоянными проблемами при ведении иностранных дел. Доктор Терао прописал постельный режим, ожидая, что его предписание будет неукоснительно выполняться, однако, возможно, что сейчас на кону стоит судьба страны и у Мацуоки есть только один шанс всё исправить."

Как известно, проблемы как с лёгкими, так и с желудком у него начались уже давно, но несмотря на рекомендации своего личного врача, Мацуока продолжал вести активный образ жизни, не обращая внимание на то, как его физическое состояние ухудшалось. По его словам, в столь трудный для страны час, пока она ещё стоит в шаге от катастрофы, он не мог сидеть сложа руки.

Эта крупная перестановка дипломатического персонала, в которой приняли участие сорок старших дипломатов, была беспрецедентной. Многие считают, что это связано с попыткой Мацуоки избавиться от тех, кто не поддерживает его взгляды на внешнюю политику, но некоторые говорят о более сложном характере этих действий. В прессе его уже прозвали «циклоном Мацуока».\n\nЦиклон "Мацуока" имеет разное значение для разных людей, которые пострадали от него. Мацуока в шутку сказал своему врачу, доктору Терао Дэнджи, что он пытается отстранить от должности тех послов, у которых жены-иностранки. Однако единственным подобным дипломатом был посол Тибо, чья жена была немкой. Личный секретарь же министра Хасэгава Шиничи, чей дом находился недалеко от дома Мацуоки в Сендагае и который часто ездил домой вместе с ним вместе на машине, считает, что Мацуока стремится к кадровым перестановкам для создания новой и вдохновляющей атмосферы внутри министерства."

Отзываемый, традиционно считавшийся «проамериканским» дипломат посылался совершить по пути какое-то действие явно антиамериканского характера – и это проделывалось с большинством послов и консулов. По его мнению, все они зависимы от стран, в которых они размещались и соответственно представляли их интересы. Он же хотел пригласить японских дипломатов, которые наилучшим образом представляли бы национальные интересы Японии.\n\nМацуоку в эти дни постоянно видели записывающим в свой блокнот множество названий государств и имён. Это подтверждает, что Мацуока «действовал в одиночку» в кадровых вопросах. Это привело к тому, что Мацуока успешно преобразовал бюрократию Касумигасэки в такую, которая в большей степени поддерживала его руководство."

Он спросил об отношении Германии к продвижению Японии в южной части Тихого океана и то, как Германия смотрела на отношения Японии с Советским Союзом. Максимальная идея Мацуоки заключалась в том, чтобы Индия, голландская Ост-Индия и французский Индокитай получат независимость после того, как Германия победит их колониальных хозяев. Ещё более грандиозный план Мацуоки предполагал, что все народы к востоку от Суэцкого канала должны быть освобождены после войны, а Германия должна искать свой рынок сбыта в Африке. Мацуока добавил, что Германия, конечно, получит доступ к природным ресурсам Юго-Восточной Азии и отдаленных регионов, но наш посол сразу же указал, что план Мацуоки потребует от Германии значительных жертв.

 NW_JAP.487.d: "Министр иностранных дел Японии Мацуока просит исключить из текста договора статьи, предполагающие взаимное обязательство объявления войны США в случае конфликта с ними одного из подписантов соглашения. Это связано с тем, что Япония не желает оказаться напрямую втянутой в войну с Америкой – очень много элементов внутри неё выступают против этого, да и сам Мацуока вырос в США и меньше всего хочет оказаться причиной войны против неё."

Он спросил об отношении Германии к продвижению Японии в южной части Тихого океана и то, как Германия смотрела на отношения Японии с Советским Союзом. Максимальная идея Мацуоки заключалась в том, чтобы Индия, голландская Ост-Индия и французский Индокитай получат независимость после того, как Германия победит их колониальных хозяев. Ещё более грандиозный план Мацуоки предполагал, что все народы к востоку от Суэцкого канала должны быть освобождены после войны, а Германия должна искать свой рынок сбыта в Африке. Мацуока добавил, что Германия, конечно, получит доступ к природным ресурсам Юго-Восточной Азии и отдаленных регионов, но наш посол сразу же указал, что план Мацуоки потребует от Германии значительных жертв. В конце Мацуока повторил вопрос о возможном заключении союза между двумя странами, на что посол ответил уклончиво."

Всего несколькими годами ранее, 12 октября 1932 года, этот же человек покинул тот же вокзал и отправился почти тем же маршрутом в Женеву для того чтобы в конечном счёте вывести Японию из Лиги Наций. После посещения Великого храма Исэ, переправы через Цусимский пролив в Корею, а затем на самолёте в Синьцзин группа Мацуоки пересекла границу между Маньчжоу-го и Сибирью. Его специальный поезд был подключен к регулярному поезду Сибирской Красной стрелы, и Сибирское путешествие Мацуоки началось.\n\nКогда в поезде подали первый ужин, Мацуока начал свою пространную речь о роли Японии в сибирской интервенции. Его сотрудники были ошеломлены. В Синьцзине их предупредили, что в поезде спрятаны подслушивающие устройства и опасались, что Мацуока выдаст важнейшие государственные секреты. Однако удержать его не было никакой возможности, поскольку их слова предостережения также могли быть записаны. Не обращая внимания на опасения сотрудников, Мацуока наслаждался икрой и коньяком и продолжал свою речь. Эта сцена повторялась каждый день, пока группа Мацуоки не прибыла в Москву.\n\nПостепенно сотрудники начали понимать, что пытался сделать Мацуока. Он обращался не к ним, а к Кремлю через скрытый микрофон. Его речь была посвящена теме того, как Соединенные Штаты и Великобритания обманули Японию и подтолкнули к интервенции в Сибирь. Поступая таким образом, они помешали Японии и Советскому Союзу Союз от превращения в близких партнеров. Он выступал за установление тесных и сердечных отношений между двумя странами. Его речи часто заканчивались напоминанием о том, что он является истинным наследником идеалов графа Гото Симпэя, который инициировал политику разрядки в отношениях с Советским Союзом в середине 20-х годов."

За ним старался следить его помощник Касе Тошикадзу, который понимал, что состояние его начальника очень тяжёлое как в физическом плане, так и в моральном. Всё это может ударить по его позициям дома, в кабинете министров, так как явно за время его отсутствия, враги которых он успел нажить, попытаются подготовить какой-то план его устранения. И если даже откладывать личные интересы на второй план, на первом остаются государственные, и большой дипломатический план Мацуоки начинает давать трещину в самом разгаре его реализации. На следующий день Мацуока демонстративно отказался от посещения нескольких мероприятий, куда он был приглашён советскими дипломатами, что должно было показать настрой готовящегося к отъезду министру. Наконец, когда время отбытия поезда, на котором японская делегация должна была ехать домой приблизилось, Мацуока окончательно потерял надежду и дав небольшие распоряжение посольству, отбыл на вокзал."

В 17:00 Мацуока снова посетил Кремль и обнаружил, что [SOV.GetLeader] тоже там присутствует. Он выиграл первый раунд их нервного состязания. На встрече Мацуока попросил его уступить Северный Сахалин, на что [SOV.GetLeader] заявил, что Мацуока "душит его”, и показал соответствующим жестом. Это растопило лед, и когда Мацуока предложил заключить пакт в стиле дипломатии блицкрига, чтобы удивить всех в мире, [SOV.GetLeader] одобрительно кивнул. В обмен на оговорку о ненападении, которой добивался Мацуока, [SOV.GetLeader] настоял на том, чтобы в текст пакта была включена нерушимость территориальной целостности как Маньчжоу-го, так и Внешней Монголии. Сталин продолжал настаивать на полной ликвидации японской концессии на Северном Сахалине, но отказался от них в обмен на обещание Мацуоки, что он убедит японское правительство отказаться от этих концессий в течение ближайших нескольких месяцев. В тот вечер Мацуока и его помощники были приглашены в Московский художественный театр на постановку “Трёх сестёр” Антона Чехова. Дипломатический корпус также присутствовал в полном составе."

Мацуока пришел помочь. За шампанским последовала водка, и Мацуока стал разговорчивым. “Я человек слова", - сказал Мацуока. “Если я когда-нибудь солгу тебе, я с радостью совершу сэппуку по японскому обычаю и подарю тебе свою голову”. “С другой стороны, - продолжил он, - если ты мне солжешь, я приду за твоей головой". [SOV.GetLeader] с улыбкой ответил: “Моя голова важна для всех народов Советского Союза, как и твоя для народа Японии. Так что давайте не будем претендовать друг на друга". За этим последовал еще один раунд тостов.\n\nМацуока подтолкнул полковника Нагаи Яцудзи и флотского командующего Фудзии Сигеру подойти к главе СССР. Ранее в тот же день они были одеты в свои деловые костюмы для посещения Кремля, но для церемонии подписания Мацуока приказал им переодеться в военную форму. Бросаясь в глаза своей внешностью, они боялись, что их униформа оскорбит чувствительность хозяев. [SOV.GetLeader] добродушно произнес тост в честь Фудзии:\n\n- Я вижу, что Вы - морской офицер. Эти американцы строят корабли без способных моряков.\n\nМацуока присоединился к нему:\n\n- Мистер [SOV.GetLeader], эти люди миниатюрны на вид, но их решимость тверда. Их дух - это тот фактор, который помог Японии победить в русско-японской войне.\n\nПомощник Мацуоки считал, что это не следует переводить, но Мацуока настаивал. [SOV.GetLeader] не потерял самообладания. Беспричинное оскорбление Мацуоки было хорошо рассчитано. Он хотел, чтобы [SOV.GetLeader] знал, что японские военные были готовы к войне, но в то же время он имел в виду и своих внутренних недоброжелателей. После такого инцидента никто не мог обвинить его в мягком отношении к коммунизму."

К тому времени, когда Мацуока появился на Московском вокзале, чтобы сесть в транссибирский поезд, отправление которого было отложено на час по прямому приказу Сталина для удобства Мацуоки, поскольку он был пьян.\n\nЗатем пришло время отправления. Сталин неожиданно появился на вокзале. Он тепло обнял Мацуоку и обменялся словами о том, что две страны вместе могли бы решить проблемы в Европе, Азии и даже во всем мире. Несколько позже Сталин обратился к немецкому военному атташе полковнику Кребсу, сначала убедился, что он немец, а затем сказал ему:\n\n- Мы останемся с вами друзьями — в любом случае!\n\nЗатем Сталин лично поднялся на борт поезда, осмотрел кухню и другие помещения и приказал присутствующим сотрудникам хорошо заботиться о его гостях. Перед отъездом он даже пожал руку Хасигути Широ, камердинеру Мацуоки. Когда надпись "МОСКВА" отошла на задний план, Мацуока и его окружение продолжали наслаждаться сладким ароматом победы."

 NW_JAP.542.d: "В связи со смертью Сайто Макото, лорда-хранителя Малой печати, нам необходимо выбрать нового человека на эту роль. Первоначально выдвигали Цунео Мацудайру – известного дипломата, посла в Соединённом Королевстве, и тестя брата императора, Ясухито, но последний настоял на том, чтобы вместо этого Мацудайра занял освободившийся пост министра императорского двора – малозначащий пост, на котором его родственник не окажется под угрозой политических убийств. Связано это с тем, что должность Лорда-хранителя Малой печати в последние годы становится особенно важна на фоне угасания института государственных старейшин (гэнро) и того, что именно Лорд-хранитель является тем, кто определяет контакты императора с политиками и сановниками.\n\nСейчас же в качестве кандидатур рассматриваются два человека. Первый это Юаса Курахей, который не принадлежит к аристократии и не имеет опыта работы в качестве министра кабинета. Однако сам император его высоко ценит за его умеренную, строгую и честную личность, которая держится на определённой дистанции и от военных, и политических партий, таким образом устанавливая впервые за долгое время на этот важный пост нейтрального человека.\n\nДругим вариантом может стать Фумимаро Коноэ – протеже господина Сайондзи, которого хотят видеть на этом посту сам Юаса Курахей, занимающий последние три года должность министра императорского двора, и президент Тайного совета Итики Китокуро. В настоящий момент Коноэ занимает пост спикера Палаты пэров. Однако он не желает в настоящий момент занимать пост лорда-хранителя Малой печати, ссылаясь на «болезнь». Вероятно, это связано с тем, что в таком случае Коноэ окажется между реформаторами из своего окружения и консерваторами из своих учителей.

Кидо проявил себя во время инцидента 26 февраля, поддерживая связь императора с гэнро Сайондзи, и занимал с тех пор несколько министерских постов. Однако Кидо всего лишь 50 лет, что является исключительным примером в практике назначения на столь важную должность, так как в его руках будет находиться вся связь императора со своими подданными и членами правительства, но его кандидатуру также одобряет армия и правые круги."

NW_JAP.544.t: "New Premier Election System"
NW_JAP.544.desc: "The Meiji Constitution does not contain any legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing a Prime Minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the "general ruler of the government," was supposed to exercise the right of appointment at will, without being limited by legal provisions or the desires of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, then the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and although this had to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appoints the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved – nine unofficial advisers to the emperor, Genrō, give him advice on whom to appoint as head of the Cabinet of Ministers, and the monarch "agrees" with their candidacy.\n\nHowever, such a decision could not be permanent due to the natural aging and death of the advisers. By the end of the Taishō period, only the great Saionji Kinmochi remained alive. Starting from this period, the emperors raised the issue of a new procedure for appointing a prime minister. Now is the time for the urgent need to choose her, as it is known that Saionji's days are numbered. Among the options being considered are the following:"
NW_JAP.544.a: "The  Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal will choose a candidate"
NW_JAP.544.b: "Senior vassals should replace the Genrō institute"

NW_JAP.545.d.a: "The head of the Privy Council, Ichiki Kitokurō, wants to resign amid the events that have occurred. He is a henchman of Genrō Saionji and an important asset of the liberal elite faction, as the Privy Council continues to play a role in the government system, despite attempts to reform or even eliminate it. Kitokurō himself, according to the old tradition, gives a recommendation for choosing his successor before leaving. His choice fell on Kiichirō Hiranuma, the baron, the gray cardinal of Japan's judicial system, and the head of the right–wing Kokuhonsha society, which has more than 200,000 members, including many generals of the Kodoha faction, nationalist and traditionalist politicians. Hiranuma had long coveted the post of head of the Privy Council, but in 1934 he was prevented from doing so by Saionji – the conflict between these two people has been going on for more than a decade, as Saionji seeks to liberalize Japanese politics, and Hiranuma wants to at least prevent this, if not even reverse some changes. However, suddenly Hiranuma himself and his supporters proposed to elect the elderly Kiyoura Keigo, an 85–year-old politician, a man of the same generation as Saionji, who once headed both the government and the Privy Council, as head of the Privy Council."

NW_JAP.546.t: "Dissolution of the Kokuhonsha"
NW_JAP.546.d: "Today, by the decision of its chairman, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, the Kokuhonsha society, which he founded in 1924 when he was Minister of Justice and leader of the House of Peers, is self-dissolving. It called on Japanese patriots to reject various foreign political 'isms' (such as socialism, communism, Marxism, anarchism, etc.) in favor of a rather vaguely defined 'Japanese national spirit' (kokutai). The name 'kokuhon' was chosen as an antithesis to the word 'minpon', from 'minpon shugi', the commonly used translation of the word 'democracy'. Accordingly, the Secret Society openly supported totalitarian ideology. Genro Saionji Kinmochi publicly criticized the organization for promoting a Japanese variety of fascism.\n\nIncluded in the Kokuhonsha were many of Hiranuma's colleagues from the Ministry of Home Affairs, important businessmen, as well as some of the most influential generals and admirals, including Sadao Araki, Jinzaburo Masaki, Saito Makoto, and Yamakawa Kenziro, and war hero Admiral Togo Heihachiro served as honorary vice-chairman. By 1936, the organization claimed to have more than 200,000 members in 170 branches. The Kokuhonsha published a monthly newspaper called 'Kokuhon' and acted as a political support group for Hiranuma.\n\nIn Kokuhon, they openly advocated a concept they called Kokumin Zentaishugi ('National Totalitarianism'), which sought to 'incorporate all parts of the Japanese state and society into one all-encompassing whole.' According to Kokuhon, the idea of Kokumin Zentaishugi was better suited to the mentality of the Japanese people than Western democracy, stating that 'the Japanese, unlike the Chinese or Jews, are incapable of living without a state.'\n\nAfter a recent incident, Hiranuma apparently decided that the organization had fulfilled its role and he no longer needed it. It is likely that he is thus showing that, having obtained the post of head of the Privy Council (directly or indirectly), and against the backdrop of the radicalism of young officers and the fact that many members of the Kokuhonsha supported the conspirators, he is ready to compromise with the liberal elites, as reformers of various stripes turned out to be too radical even for him after the series of murders that took place."
NW_JAP.546.a: "Hiranuma was horrified by those he had created"

NW_JAP.547.t: "Probationary Supervision Law for Political Offenses" 
NW_JAP.547.d: "For several years, Baron Hiranuma has been trying to revise the Peace Preservation Law to strengthen it by introducing a procedure for preventive detention. Today, he is again trying to overcome resistance, primarily parliamentary, by putting forward a new bill for discussion at the 69th session of parliament, which is not formally a revision of existing legislation.\n\nThe creator of the new law is Takeichiro Moriyama, director of the probation department of the Ministry of Justice. Moriyama, who is responsible for the bill, stated that 'we have completely discarded the existing circumstances and developed the bill on a completely new basis,' and stressed that the Probation Law for Offenders was based on 'protective guidance' rather than 'intimidation and oppression.' The purpose of the law is to 'prevent the re-offending of those who have changed their ideology, and to encourage those who have not changed their ideology to change their ideology.' This refers to the practice promoted by the secret police of 'changing views' among those convicted under the Peace Preservation Law, where a person officially declared that he had abandoned his former ideas (most often communist or Marxist) and remembered his 'Japanese spirit.'\n\nDuring the parliamentary debates, the left-wing independent politician Kato KanjQ spoke out against the bill, pointing out that the recidivism rate among violators of the Peace Preservation Law was low, at about 3 percent (compared to about 35 percent for ordinary crimes), and that the bill would violate the constitutional right to freedom of residence and movement."

The original book was published in Munich on December 15, 1934, and is a massive work of over 1600 pages, created through the joint efforts of more than 100 Nazi scholars.

As is known, the initiator of the translation and publication of such a work is Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, the author of the Peace Preservation Law, the main lobbyist for strict criminal legislation, and the leader of the conservative part of the elites."

NW_JAP.549.t: "Hirota Decides to Resign"
NW_JAP.549.desc.a: "Prime Minister Hirota Koki has decided to resign as he has done everything he could to eliminate the consequences of the military putsch and implement his reforms. There are already several suitable candidates to replace him. First and foremost is Prince Konoe, who has long been prepared for this role by the elderly genro Saionji Kinmochi. Now Konoe himself, who had previously refused the offer to become prime minister several times, has announced that he is ready to take power. Another possible candidate is the leader of the group of bureaucratic reformers, Fumio Goto, a man who has already been a cabinet minister and even acting prime minister during the young officers' putsch. A third possible person could be General Kanji Ishiwara, the leader of the Manchurian faction within the army, which is known for having organized the seizure of Manchuria, thanks to which Ishiwara became a popular figure among young and middle-ranking officers. He has rather unusual views, as he is, for example, an opponent of war with China and a staunch supporter of Pan-Asianism."

NW_JAP.550.t: "The Death of Saionji Kinmochi"
NW_JAP.550.d: "Starting in February 1939, the health of the last genro, Saionji, often deteriorated, and in the summer of 1940, instead of his usual summer vacation at his villa in Gotemba, he had an air conditioner installed in his room at his usual residence, Zagyoso. Realizing that he was close to death, Saionji distributed money to close friends as commemorative gifts. In November, he developed pyelonephritis, and although he fully recovered, he could not bear the weakness and finally passed away on the evening of November 24 at 9:54 PM. He was 92 years old at the time of his death. Saionji had expressed his intention to refuse a state funeral, saying, 'Even after death, I will not need the care of monks or Shinto priests.' Nevertheless, a grand state funeral was held in Hibiya Park. Tens of thousands of people attended, and 8,000 people visited Zagyoso, which was opened to the public on the same day."

NW_JAP.551 .d: "Konoe's circle has almost completed the formation of a new political party. The only unresolved issue is the choice of a name for this party. Three possible names have been proposed by different groups of politicians."

NW_JAP.552.t: "Hisashi Aso's Speech in Parliament"
NW_JAP.552.d: "At the first meeting of the Imperial Parliament after the suppression of the military rebellion, Hisashi Aso, the general secretary of the Shakai Taishuto party, delivered a speech on behalf of the party:\n\n- I believe that the key to national reform lies in stabilizing the lives of the people and giving society hope for tomorrow, while dealing a decisive blow to capitalist institutions, carrying out decisive internal reforms, and breaking old political abuses through the forced implementation of the Showa Restoration.\n\n'Being determined to carry out the Showa Restoration and internal reforms' — were these not the heroic words of the Young Officers in the days of the past putsch? Perhaps that is why, unlike other congressmen, Aso did not criticize the behavior of the military or the generals of the Kodoha faction at this parliamentary session. This is not surprising; his faction within the party, ever since the publication of the 'Army Pamphlet' in 1934, has taken a benevolent position towards the military and their desire to build a national defense state. They are ready to support them in exchange for the implementation of some socialist reforms. In the elections, his party, the only left-wing party in parliament, increased its number of deputy mandates to 24 people.\n\nAnother member of the Diet, Takao Saito, a member of the Rikken Minseito party, boldly criticized the concept of the Showa Restoration: 'Praise the transformation of the country, but do not know what the transformation of the country is; praise the Showa Restoration, but do not understand what the Showa Restoration is.'"
NW_JAP.552.a: "It is hard to realize that even in parliament, there were defenders of the conspirators' actions"
NW_JAP.553.t: "Hisashi Aso's Article"
NW_JAP.553.d: "The General Secretary of the left-wing party Shakai Taishuto, Hisashi Aso, published his new article in the June issue of the magazine 'Reform', the party's print organ: 'It is obvious that capitalism can no longer guarantee national life as it did in the past, so the need for social reforms is urgently required.' At the same time, Aso also said directly: 'The reform of our country must be centered on the parliament and carried out through the parliament, that is, parliamentary politics. Therefore, the biggest political priority today should be the reform of the parliament. The parliament itself must be able to correctly reflect the needs of life and the hopes of the people.'"
NW_JAP.553.a: "Well, at least they want to carry out their reforms through parliament, not by force"
NW_JAP.554.t: "Major Katakura's Plan"
NW_JAP.554.d: "The Ishiwara-Miyazaki five-year plan is undergoing a long period of discussion in the highest financial circles and bureaucracy. It has become clear that this plan cannot be implemented in Japan itself immediately. Additional research was conducted, according to which it was decided to shorten it for use in Manchukuo. The Bureau of Military Affairs and the Bureau of Equipment and Supplies of the Ministry of Defense proposed a sum of 2.3 billion yen for twenty-two projects under the plan. Major Tadashi Katakura presented this plan to General Seishiro Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, who agreed to it."
NW_JAP.554.a: "Excellent, they will test it somewhere else first"
NW_JAP.555.t: "The Only Officer with an Iron Neck"
NW_JAP.555.d: "It is believed that Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, the initiator of the seizure of Manchuria in 1931, played the greatest role in the suppression. Despite the fact that many young officers among the putschists counted on Ishiwara's support, and in fact admired his actions, he, being appointed head of martial law in Tokyo, carried out the most consistent and tough policy towards the conspirators. Although the emperor's instructions were to quickly attack the rebels' positions, in the martial law headquarters itself there were fierce and emotional disagreements over the prospect of a military confrontation.\n\nIshiwara's sheer willpower broke through the fog of hesitation at headquarters. On the evening of the second day of the mutiny, several officers sympathetic to the rebels came to the headquarters to demand a postponement of action against the rebels. Their passionate and eloquent appeal made a deep impression on most of those present at the crowded meeting. Ishiwara listened in silence for a long time to the vacillations of the other officers, after which he rose from the corner of the huge table at which the martial law staff sat and announced in a loud voice:\n\n- We will immediately begin preparations for the assault. All units will assemble for this purpose. Stepping to the door, he stopped and, turning, added, 'The army will wait until noon tomorrow, then it will begin the offensive and suppress this uprising.'\n\nHe gave several specific orders to the various assault units and then withdrew. If ever there was a right man in the right place, it was Colonel Ishiwara."
NW_JAP.555.a: "Tokyo was saved thanks to his courage and composure" 
NW_JAP.556.t: "Unexpected Conclusion of the Teijin Company Trial" 
NW_JAP.556.desc: "In June 1933, a group of young investors, the Banchokai, acquired 100,000 shares of Teijin (a leading rayon and textile firm) from the Bank of Taiwan at a price of 125 yen per share. The shares steadily rose in price, reaching 200 yen per share by the end of the year, and rumors began to appear in the editorial pages of various newspapers that the Banchokai had somehow managed to manipulate the market.\n\nWorking with this unfounded rumor, ultra-right-wing officials in the Ministry of Justice accused officials in the Ministry of Finance and members of the Saito Cabinet of colluding with the Bank of Taiwan to allow the Banchokai to buy shares at an artificially low price in exchange for cash and stock bribes. In April 1934, the Ministry of Justice ordered the arrest of the Deputy Minister of Finance, the director of the Bank of Taiwan, and the president of Teijin. Upon receiving news that a number of cabinet ministers were also to be arrested, Prime Minister Saito dissolved the government on July 3, 1934. Shortly thereafter, thirteen more officials were arrested on corruption charges. In total, corruption charges were brought against 16 people. The trial began in 1935.\n\nBut today, after 265 trials, all the defendants were acquitted. The court stated that the stock trading was conducted correctly and, therefore, the defendants were innocent. But the public still feels the taste of corruption, both within the bureaucracy and in the financial world, and this has undermined confidence in both the ideology of liberalism and the market economy. Back in 1934, there was talk that the entire prosecution was the result of a conspiracy by the faction of Fusanosuke Kuhara, one of the leaders of the Rikken SeiyQkai, the judicial elder and deputy chairman of the Privy Council Hiranuma Kiichiro, the military, and the right wing. A critic of this approach, the entrepreneur Muto Sanji, was killed by a right-wing fanatic in 1934."

NW_JAP.556.d: "It's better to leave this in the past as it will cause more problems"
NW_JAP.557.t: "Fundamental Principles of Kokutai"
NW_JAP.557.d: "In response to calls for the need to answer the question of kokutai, the government formed a committee of Japan's leading professors to discuss this issue. As a result of their work, they released a document titled Kokutai no Hongi (Fundamental Principles of the National Polity). It was a 156-page brochure, officially published by the Ministry of Education of Japan. This brochure is intended primarily for distribution among teachers throughout the country, but will also be sold openly to anyone who wishes.\n\nThe brochure contains the official position of the Japanese state on all aspects of domestic policy, international relations, culture, and civilization. It clearly states its purpose: to overcome social unrest and create a new Japan. In this brochure, students are taught to put the interests of the nation above their own, and that they are part of the state, not separate from it. It also explains the principle of hakko ichiu ('eight corners, one roof'). Defining the national polity as 'The Great Japanese Empire will be governed forever in accordance with the divine decree of the Emperor, who has been a continuous line of emperors for centuries. This is our national polity, which will never change,' it not only rejects communism and anarchism, but also considers democracy and liberalism incompatible with the national polity.\n\nA separate point criticizes the theory of the emperor as an organ of the state: 'The Emperor is the subject of sovereignty, and the theory that the subject of sovereignty is the state, and the emperor is merely its organ, has no basis other than the uncritical borrowing of Western nationalist theory. The Emperor is not simply the so-called head of state, monarch, sovereign, or ruling authority in foreign states, but governs this country in accordance with the just cause that has existed since the founding of the country, and Article 3 states that 'The Emperor is sacred and inviolable' to make this clear. Similar provisions found in foreign states are, of course, not based on such a deep meaning, but are merely an attempt to secure the position of the head of state by law.'"
NW_JAP.557.a: "The manual has been handed down"
NW_JAP.558.t: "Awkward Questions in Parliament"
NW_JAP.558.d: "At a meeting of the Imperial Parliament, Sobei Hara of the Rikken SeiyQkai party asked the Minister of Education a question about a fragment from 'The Meaning of Kokutai,' which stated: 'This is not the rule of the Emperor and the people, and it is not a system of separation of the three powers or a system of rule of law, but rather a system of direct rule by the Emperor.' He asked:\n\n- If this is not a 'system of rule of law,' then where is the Japanese system of rule of law? If there is even a great body of laws for governing the country, such as the Meiji Constitution, is it not a country governed by law?\n\nThe Minister of Education replied that he would like to consider this matter carefully, and at the moment the 'Fundamental Principles of Kokutai' had not yet become 'sacred scripture,' so there might be some amendments in the future. In addition, many members of the cabinet had not yet read the brochure on the meaning of kokutai that was now being distributed."
NW_JAP.558.a: "It seems the text of the brochure should have been approached more carefully"
NW_JAP.559.t: "The Way of the Subjects"
NW_JAP.559.d: "One of the main themes of the book is dedicated to the direct descent of Emperor Showa from the goddess Amaterasu and the religious characterization of Kokutai, which was defined as a 'theocracy' in which 'The Way of the Emperor's subjects comes from the Emperor's policy and consists in guarding and maintaining the Imperial Throne, which coexists with heaven and earth.' Emperor Showa and his war (seisen) are described as 'holy.' The virtues he embodied were unique and unchanging.\n\n'The Imperial Family is the source of the Japanese nation, and national and private life spring from this. The way of the subject is to be loyal to the Emperor, without caring for oneself, thereby supporting the Imperial Throne, which coexists with Heaven and Earth.'\n\nFilial piety and loyalty were the highest virtues of the subjects of the imperial state, and the book condemned 'individualism,' liberalism, utilitarianism, and materialism, which endangered these virtues: 'the country has been infected with perverted thinking, and it is our sacred duty to cleanse it and return to the virtuous customs of our ancestors. It is by working in harmony and cooperation and displaying our national dignity that we must obey the Heavenly Spirits of our Ancestors properly, which, by working in harmony with others, will contribute to the greater glory of the Throne.'\n\nThe brochure also claims that the Western powers have for centuries sought world domination and have been very successful in this, as evidenced by the fact that only a few thousand Europeans now ruled over 450 million Asians. The Western value system, based on greed and self-indulgence, is considered guilty of countless bloody aggressive wars and the current world economic crisis. America was singled out for special criticism, with mention of black slavery and the mistreatment of minorities and immigrants.\n\nOther sections are devoted to correct social and moral customs, some racial and eugenic ideas, theology and religion, military doctrines, and other aspects of Japanese customs."

NW_JAP.561 .t: "A Gift for the Premier"
NW_JAP.561 .d: "The other day, one of General Tojo's friends gave him a Siamese cat. Many expected an indifferent reaction to such a gift from the tough general, who had even earned the nickname 'the Razor,' but he was unexpectedly pleased with it. The cat came to live at Tojo's house, and his rare visitors could see him sitting at his desk with the cat on the table."
NW_JAP.561.a: "Cats can melt even Tojo's heart"
NW_JAP.562.t: "Demand for the Dissolution of Other Political Associations"
NW_JAP.562.d: "After the elections, the recommended candidates who were successful were united into a party called the 'Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association,' and the government announced that it no longer recognized any other political associations. This was the final step in establishing a genuine one-party state. After these statements, the major newspaper publishers Ogata and Tokutomi used their influence to secure the approval of the membership of the members of the Diet of the Tohokai party, which they supported, in the Association, while the party itself, after negotiations with its leader Seigo Nakano, will be transformed into a non-political association for moral thought called the Toho Jikai, 'Society of Eastern Comrades.' At the same time, auxiliary bodies such as the Youth Corps, as well as a public periodical called 'Totairiku,' or 'Eastern Review,' will be preserved."
NW_JAP.562.a: "The fascists turned out to be the only coherent opposition..." 
NW_JAP.563.t: "Discontent with the Dissolution of the Tohokai"
NW_JAP.563.d: "Protests against the dissolution of the Tohokai swept across the country, and, given the danger that some members of the organization might resort to violence, Seigo Nakano wrote a detailed justification that the Tohokai was, after all, originally a cultural organization working on a plane beyond everyday politics, in the sense of the functioning of established institutions in which no more divisions were allowed. The party was only returning to this role, and its spirit was indestructible. However, he added that he 'felt a weariness from twelve years of fierce struggle suddenly descend upon him.' Originally, the party (besides the Youth Corps) had branches in twenty prefectures, as well as in Tokyo, with about 15,000 members. However, its level of activity is rapidly declining, and it is said that Nakano began to wonder whether it would be better for him to take up writing or science, especially when old friends noted that his early journalistic works were much more valuable than anything he had written as a politician."
NW_JAP.563.a: "It seems we have managed to get rid of this thorn in our side in the form of Nakano"
NW_JAP.564.t: "Nakano's Historical Notes"
NW_JAP.564.d: "Seigo Nakano has retired from active politics. He now has free time to return to more scholarly pursuits, and he mainly lectures at his Shinjuku academy on various works of Chinese and Japanese classics, but especially on the late Tokugawa supporter, the historian Rai San'yo. Two main lecture series are devoted to Hideyoshi and the short-lived but famous Kemmu Restoration of 1333.\n\nMeanwhile, he had to resort to an alternative way of venting his irrepressible energy, reflecting on and discussing heroic episodes of past eras, while at the same time hoping that the seeds sown in the minds of his listeners would prepare them for new efforts when the opportunity arose. His lectures on the Kemmu Restoration were written quite well, although he read them not as a specialist, but with the aim of commenting on current events and his own experience.\n\nSince he is under increasingly close surveillance by the Special Higher ('Thought') Police and the Kempeitai, he has no other alternative but to speak in terms of national politics or restorationist rhetoric, although he has an additional motive for this, as he has begun to support Japanist politicians who are steadily becoming more hostile to the Tojo regime. In expressing his own views, he is forced to resort to more or less indirect historical allusions, often displaying his good ironic wit."
NW_JAP.564.a: "Nakano remains a popular figure"
NW_JAP.565.t: "The World Thrives on Personality"
NW_JAP.565.d: "Recently, Seigo Nakano delivered a speech to a wide audience at Waseda University, which he himself had graduated from, which he called 'The World Thrives on Personality.' The title comes from a classic Chinese proverb: 'A state thrives on personality and is destroyed because of personality.' Beginning with a review of the complex military situation, Nakano elaborated on the irony of the situation where officials responsible for material production, such as Nobusuke Kishi, pay primary attention to issues of morale.\n\nHe also condemned Kishi's distinction between the 'Anglo-American' or 'Jewish' pursuit of profit, associated with liberalism, and the 'Japanese spirit' of completely selfless service, pointing out that long before Western influence was felt, Mitsui, Noike, and the proverbial Zeniya Gohё diligently sought profit. This does not need to be condemned as long as private initiative and creativity are guided by public interests, as opposed to the suffocation of their organic life by mechanical submission to bureaucratic control. The latter, as he had often argued before, was the real 'Jewish mentality.'"
NW_JAP.565.a: "Nakano... remembered that he was once a liberal?"
NW_JAP.566.t: "Criticism of Bureaucrats"
NW_JAP.566.d: "Nakano analyzed the history of the strengthening of bureaucratic control in Japan. According to him, before the Manchurian Incident, the useless alternation of 'positive' and 'negative' policies was criticized by both right-wing opponents of liberalism and pacifism, and by left-wing intellectuals. Many of the latter suffered from repression, but less dedicated people entered the bureaucratic apparatus and comfortably overcame their radicalism. When reforms became necessary after Manchuria, the army, as its main defender, rejected the parliamentary parties, but was forced to replace them on the political scene with bureaucratic reformers, whose only theoretical resource was the semi-leftist views left over from their student days. Therefore, they adopted an unreasonable policy of rationalization through amalgamation, putting quantity above quality and combining the vices of monopolistic capitalism and state control. Nakano cited specific cases revealed during the investigations of his Youth Corps."
NW_JAP.566.a: "Nakano strikes back"
NW_JAP.567.t: "Japanese Patriotic Liberalism"
NW_JAP.567.d: "Returning to basic theory, he condemned the current fashion of belittling any liberalism as an Anglo-American ideology. Praising the slogan 'Give me liberty or give me death!', he interpreted it as an affirmation of the supreme responsibility of the individual, who can achieve more than any system of coercion. The pioneering liberalism of Itagaki Taisuke, he said, was completely Japanese and patriotic, as it arose from his observations of how, during the campaign to suppress the opposition to the Meiji Restoration, the peasantry in the hostile feudal domain of Aizu was completely indifferent to the outcome, because feudalism had deprived them of all sense of belonging to society and deprived them of freedom of choice and responsibility. Therefore, Itagaki sought to provide the Japanese people with a social stake and commitment to ensuring all their efforts for the greatness of their country. Japanese liberalism, therefore, was not anti-monarchical, as its Western counterpart often was, but merely opposed an official system that denied the rights of the people. In contrast to Kishi's approach, Nakano continued to promote a policy of stimulating the masses and self-sacrifice on the part of those in leadership positions, since the latter should be most endowed with public spirit (as patriots). He was particularly moved by the example of Clemenceau, who, in times of greatest danger to France, swept away a corrupt administration, won over rebellious workers, and inspired the troops by personal example at the front. It was clear enough that Nakano hoped that another Clemenceau would appear in Japan to save the situation, a role he would have been more than willing to play himself, although in the Japanese style, a more high-ranking person might have been required as the main hero."
NW_JAP.567.a: "Nakano wants to become the Japanese Clemenceau..."
NW_JAP.568.t: "The Second Speech"
NW_JAP.568.d: "After urging the students to write their own 'Mein Kampf,' Nakano concluded his speech with a call to abandon opportunism, the root of all evils:\n\n- The great ship of Japan is drifting on a stormy sea, endangered by a whole detachment of opportunists. Awaken yourselves! Let the world thrive through each individual! I sincerely hope for this, my beloved fellow graduates.\n\nHe repeated this speech in a more popular form at the Hibiya Hall under the title 'Form a National Battle Order for a Certain Victory!', although in it he expressed disapproval of 'direct action' (terrorism) as a manifestation of simple aspiration without guiding principles. The police did not intervene because of the frantic enthusiasm of the large crowd of 4,000 people who paid the usual 30 yen to fill the hall to capacity, while twice as many people gathered outside. However, all further public speeches by Nakano were banned.\n\nBans and censorship of 'Tairiku,' Nakano's publication, were tightened, and even the latest issue of 'Asahi Shimbun' was banned for publishing an article by Nakano on wartime prime ministers. Although this was done with the help of cautious historical allusions, some of them were very eloquent, for example, the fact that Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff were magnificent on the battlefield, but when they received supreme control over the war, they failed to show proper trust in the people, instead restricting them and 'trampling on their patriotism,' imposing on them a military policy and slavish hard labor."
NW_JAP.568.a: "How did he manage to combine a call for liberalism and the book of a Nazi ideologue in one speech..."
NW_JAP.569.t: "Confrontation in Parliament"
NW_JAP.569.d: "A round of protests was directed against the amended Special Wartime Crimes Law, which prohibited any action aimed at disrupting the work of the National Government. The opposition in the regular advisory committee was led by Seigo Nakano's assistant, Takeo Mitamura, probably because of his legal background. He argued that the ban on any initiative to change a particular cabinet would turn it into a dictatorship that could not be challenged constitutionally.\n\nExtremist patriotic societies actively lobbied and agitated against the proposed law. Since such steps to strengthen the government were linked to plans to tighten economic control, which threatened a significant share of the zaibatsu in the management system, it is likely that the alliance between the zaibatsu and the Japanists was still ongoing. At the same time, emotional factors, such as dissatisfaction with the meager share of influence of the far right, must have played a certain role. An alliance of fifteen right-wing groups distributed several brochures denouncing the bill, which gave the current government an inviolability equal to the eternal state structure, and thus amounted to a new shogunate.\n\nA prominent representative of the opposition was Amano Tatsuo, a lawyer with exceptional fanaticism. In a recent issue of the newspaper 'Ishin Kuron,' he wrote that Tojo was using the war to usurp the emperor's prerogatives - like the shoguns and other similar villains of the restorationist ilk - and described him as a 'traitor and rebel, destroying the calm order in the national state,' who is in the power of 'pseudo-renouncers of communism.' As a result, he was arrested for a time. These efforts of the right were supported in parliament by such party liberals as Ichiro Hatoyama and Miki Bukichi, but the influence of the ruling party on the majority of parliament members allowed the bill to pass."
NW_JAP.569.a: "Is there any chance of stopping Tojo?"
NW_JAP.570.t: "Protest in Parliament"
NW_JAP.570.d: "Another confrontation occurred at a special session of parliament convened to pass two important economic control measures, when the right wing, including supporters of Seigo Nakano, formed a special society to coordinate the opposition. But since the three-day session was limited to formalities, the only opportunity to express protest was a meeting of members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, at which the liberals Hatoyama, Bukichi Miki, and the fascist Seigo Nakano took an active joint position, and Nakano condemned corruption in the government by 'sycophants.'\n\nAfter this, there was an incident with Akao Bin, this young leader of right-wing extremist groups publicly reprimanded the prime minister during a speech, after which he was expectedly expelled from parliament and from the ruling party. After that, those who voted against his expulsion, Nakano, Hatoyama, and others, left the party in protest."
NW_JAP.570.a: "They can't do anything"
NW_JAP.571.t: "A Weaving Conspiracy"
NW_JAP.571.d.a: "Various specific reports of dissatisfaction with the current government and attempts to remove it have begun to come in. One of the first was information about a meeting at the home of Yoshida Shigeru of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was attended by Kojima Kazuo, Ikeda of the Mitsui zaibatsu, and military personnel from the Kodoha faction, who discussed the possibility of forming a cabinet headed by General Ugaki, apparently the most acceptable figure in the army outside the Toseiha faction. It is also known that Prince Konoe is obsessed with the danger of communist subversion if the war drags on or ends too catastrophically, while Kiichiro Hiranuma suspected Tojo himself of 'red ideas.'\n\nIn the government, Matsumae Shigeyoshi of the Ministry of Communications compiled a 150-page report on the technical shortcomings of military production and distributed it among former prime ministers and naval circles, including Prince Takamatsu, a captain and the emperor's brother. In addition, a senior researcher at the Planning Board, Tanabe Tadao, published an article with critical remarks in the latest issue of 'Ishin Kuron,' which attracted the attention of Seigo Nakano, who is currently considered to be the main driving force behind the conspiracy."
NW_JAP.571.d.b: "$NW_JAP.571.d.a$\n\nThe only real possibility for the success of the movement against the prime minister is the mobilization of high-ranking statesmen who have been given the right to appoint prime ministers - a group consisting of all former prime ministers, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido Koichi, and the chairman of the Privy Council. Kido in this group is our main ally, as it was he who was largely responsible for Tojo's appointment as prime minister and is unwilling to even think about changing the cabinet in wartime, so he does everything possible to inform the head of the cabinet of any actions against him, and in addition he keeps the emperor largely isolated from other elements."
NW_JAP.571.a: "It's that Nakano again"
NW_JAP.572.t: "Nakano and the Senior Vassals"
NW_JAP.572.d: "Nakano did not see the high-ranking statesmen as promising material and spoke of them as those who needed to be constantly wound up like puppets. In the past, he had attacked them all with a certain amount of bitterness, sometimes ironically for being indifferent to the policies of the military, but he realized that there was no other way. Therefore, he created a network of collaborators, trying to influence them. He formed a particularly close alliance with Tatsuo Amano, whose article against Tojo in the newspaper 'Ishin Kuron' had impressed him, although Amano's earlier connection with terrorism would have been a hindrance from the point of view of the high-ranking statesmen. Contact was established with Matsumae by visiting him in the hospital, and with Tanabe through one of the ubiquitous natives of Fukuoka named Hinoshita, who was on his staff. Nakano arranged for Tanabe to travel to Konoe, and then he drew up a 'Plan for the Reconstruction of the Military Economy.' Additional data on the private sector of the economy were obtained from Tsuda Shingo of the Kanebo zaibatsu, who provided constant support to Nakano during this period. Immediately after leaving the ruling party, Nakano visited Prince Naruhiko, the emperor's uncle and a member of the Supreme War Council, with whom he had previously maintained contact and who was already sometimes considered a potential prime minister."
NW_JAP.572.a: "Let's try to offer Nakano some government position, maybe he'll calm down"
NW_JAP.573.t: "Movement Against the Cabinet"
NW_JAP.573.d: "New information has been received from the secret police about the movement against the government. The campaign was organized during a visit at the end of July to the mountain resort of Karuizawa, where Prince Konoe, General Ugaki, and the former party leader Hatoyama had their villas. In addition to taking his son with him, Seigo Nakano was accompanied by the lawyer Tatsuo Amano and his son, Nakano's right-hand man, Takeo Mitamura, and his secretary, Hinoshita. Shigeyoshi Matsumae traveled separately and paid a visit to Konoe, asking him to work with the emperor, while Hinoshita presented his and Tanabe's 'reconstruction plan' to all three prominent political figures. Nakano Yasuo recalls delivering a sealed message to Konoe's villa and arranging a telephone meeting with Ugaki at one of the several dinners that Hatoyama treated the conspirators to.\n\nNakano returned to Tokyo in an optimistic mood. It so happened that Yoshida Shigeru was traveling on the same train. Shortly thereafter, Mitamura prepared a brochure under his own name, 'The Management of the IRAA and the Kokutai Constitution,' in which he explained the reasons for his departure from the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association. In it, he criticized the single national party system as a new shogunate and condemned the way the monolithic Tojo regime, combining the government, the IRAA, and the APT, had deprived the Diet of its constitutional function of overseeing the executive branch: 'It is important to leave the way open for criticism of the administration. Without criticism, there is no reflection. Without reflection, there is no improvement. Criticism encourages purposeful efforts, and such efforts are a national asset.' Two thousand of its copies were distributed to members of parliament, ministers, privy councilors, newspapers, and prominent intellectuals, although a ban on their publication soon followed, naturally."

NW_JAP.574.t: "Mobilization of Shigeyoshi Matsumae"
NW_JAP.574.d: "Shigeyoshi Matsumae, Director General of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and a young representative of the bureaucratic reformers, has been mobilized for military service. This was done thanks to an urgent amendment to the Military Service Law: previously, it stipulated that the maximum age of conscripts was 40 (and Matsumae is now 42), but now it has been raised to 45. It took only three days to consider this amendment. He was drafted as a private and sent to the front. The reason for this was that Matsumae had gathered engineers to conduct a thorough investigation into the huge difference in production capacity between Japan and the United States and had distributed the results to the military command and Prince Konoe, hoping for Tojo's resignation. Even many of Tojo's opponents in the army were outraged by such a blatant violation of the law for the sake of petty revenge and political struggle."

NW_JAP.575.t: "Meeting with the Senior Vassals"
NW_JAP.575.d: "Concrete steps by the high-ranking statesmen began when Okada, at a meeting with Koichi Kido, suggested that Tojo could be appointed Chief of the General Staff and resign as prime minister. Kido replied that this could be done if 'public opinion' required it, which, he said, could be considered represented by the consensus of the high-ranking statesmen if necessary. Therefore, Okada secured the consent of the ex-prime ministers to meet with Tojo, inviting him to come alone in the hope that they could speak frankly and emphasize the general's personal responsibility for the work of the government. However, with Kido's support, the prime minister managed to insist on being accompanied by his usual public relations assistants (the ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and the navy, as well as the chairman of the Planning Board), as a result of which the high-ranking statesmen were unable to exert the necessary pressure."
NW_JAP.575.a: "It's time to deal with Nakano and his group"
NW_JAP.576.t: "Arrest of Takeo Mitamura"
NW_JAP.576.d: "The other day, Seigo Nakano's closest assistant, Takeo Mitamura, was arrested. First, censorship officials interrogated him for a week about his brochure, which he had published more than a month ago, then he was interrogated in more detail by the Special Higher Police on suspicion of violating the Special Wartime Crimes Law, as well as on the actual case of inciting right-wing students to assassinate Tojo by a member of Tatsuo Amano's group 'Makotomusubi.' A copy of a document containing a list of the planned cabinet of General Ugaki by the conspirators also fell into the hands of the police. However, during the interrogations, Mitamura held up perfectly, relying on his legal and practical experience as a former police officer of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs."
NW_JAP.576.a: "We need to arrest Nakano immediately"
NW_JAP.577.t: "Resistance from Prosecutors"
NW_JAP.577.d: "The head of the investigation department of the Prosecutor General's Office, Nakamura Toneo, refused to authorize Nakano's arrest, as the check on Mitamura had not yielded sufficient evidence. The prosecutors are apparently hostile to the prime minister, considering it their duty, as employees of the Ministry of Justice, to restrain the actions of the police and the Kempeitai. In addition, given the influence of Kiichiro Hiranuma in this ministry, they may well also regard Tojo with distrust, as a threat to national policy.\n\nAnd yet, early this morning, Seigo Nakano was temporarily arrested on the initiative of the police, along with all the officials of the Toho Jikai and Makotomusubi, a total of more than 100 people. He managed to give his son a copy of the 'Reconstruction of the Military Economy' before the police confiscated all the other documents, along with eleven swords from Nakano's personal collection.\n\nAlthough the police tried to get a confession from him for spreading false rumors, no particular progress was made, as they were unable to formulate enough evidence to satisfy the prosecutor's office. Meanwhile, Hatoyama and other activists were agitating in the parliament offices against the illegal detention of two deputies without charges. At a meeting convened at Tojo's residence to make a quick decision, Prosecutor General Matsuzaka denied that there were grounds for charging Nakano, while the dominant figure in the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association, Asa Tadao, warned that parliament would not agree to Nakano's detention without charges during the session, as this contradicted Article 53 of the constitution."

NW_JAP.577.b: "Since both the judicial and executive branches are against us, we can't do anything with him"
NW_JAP.578.t: "Nakano's Confession"
NW_JAP.578.d: "Faced with such resistance from both the judicial and legislative branches, Tojo turned to his immediate support, the Kempeitai, and his closest protege in it, Colonel Shikata RyQji, who promised to obtain a confession from Nakano by the time of the arraignment the next day, in order to prevent him from attending parliament. Early in the morning, Nakano was secretly taken out of his cell, and at noon the Kempeitai reported to the Prosecutor General's Office his confession to spreading rumors that disagreements between the army and the navy had led to defeats at the front. The first thought of the editor-in-chief of the Asahi Shimbun, Taketaro Ogata, when he heard about the confession, was the possibility of torture, but there were no signs of torture on Nakano's body, who was released from detention.\n\nThe prosecutor Nakamura now had no choice but to accept a statement from Nakano in order to apply to the district court for a formal charge, which he still hoped would not be serious enough to justify Nakano's further detention. He ignored the meaningless additional charge of lese-majeste brought by the Kempeitai on the basis of contacts with Prince Naruhiko. However, when Nakano arrived, Nakamura was struck by his 'oriental humility.'\n\nThe parliament naturally did not agree to allow the detention of a deputy for such a minor crime, so Nakano was released home, albeit under the supervision of two policemen who were sent with him. He also gave a written undertaking that he would not attend parliamentary sessions to the head of the metropolitan military police."
NW_JAP.578.a: "Nakano surrendered? Why? What happened?"
NW_JAP.579.t: "Nakano Commits Harakiri"
NW_JAP.579.d: "Nakano returned home early in the morning, accompanied by a policeman, who was later joined by another. He told his son: 'It's all over. I won't have to go there anymore.' The ambiguity of these phrases would only be understood by everyone later, as would his message to his assistant Mitamura 'not to follow him.' In his mother's room, he found the last remaining sword after the search, which he took to 'clean it.' In the evening, after what turned out to be a farewell dinner, he asked all family members to disperse by ten o'clock to let him rest, and the two policemen were placed in the guest room. Earlier, he had ordered the photographs of Hitler and Mussolini to be removed from his room and replaced them with a statue of Kusunoki Masashige on horseback and one volume of Saigo's biography. Then he was busy writing farewell notes until exactly midnight, when, after making two cuts on his stomach in observance of samurai traditions, he committed suicide by cutting his carotid artery.\n\nHis body was discovered the next morning. The two accompanying policemen denied having noticed anyone, and eventually the suspicions against them, which the local police were ready to investigate, were refuted by Nakano's personal doctor. He also noted that this would not have happened if Nakano's wife, who died of tuberculosis in 1934, had been alive. Several brief notes were found in the family altar in an envelope addressed to Toyama, the head of the Amur River Society. They were addressed to all of Nakano's relatives, his main colleagues, and various friends, even his late father, wife, and sons, in which he expressed the hope of reuniting with them. Other notes greeted the imperial army, in others he asked that his horses be properly cared for, and expressed gratitude to the family for having had the good fortune to gather one last time and find one remaining sword. Other records left by Nakano included a complaint about the dullness of the sword and his resignation from parliament, which indicates the responsibility he believed he shared with this institution for the grim prospects now facing Japan." 
NW_JAP.579.a: "What influenced Nakano so much?"
NW_JAP.580.t: "Nakano's Devotion"
NW_JAP.580.d: "Naturally, there was much speculation about the motives for Nakano's suicide. The key to the mystery is a remark made by the policeman who remained in Nakano's house to his son: 'Your father was very worried about both of you.' This seems to mean that since Nakano's eldest surviving son had already been drafted into the army, and the younger was about to be drafted, the chief of the metropolitan military police could threaten to deal with them, perhaps by sending them to a combat zone where they would have no hope of survival. Choosing between the lives of his sons and continuing his political activities, he chose the former. But since he felt his personal responsibility for the start of the war, coupled with his inability to influence politics any longer, which he had been doing for the past 15 years, it led him to the thought of taking his own life.\n\nThe two social groups most agitated by this event were, on the one hand, representatives of the small business class, who formed the core of Nakano's supporters, and, on the other hand, the ultranationalists, whose ideology was the source of many of his statements, especially in the early and late stages of his activity. Representatives of the first group were most noticeable at his funeral, which, despite the ban by officials, was attended by 20,000 mourners, including a large number of politicians and journalists. One of Konoe's advisers commented:\n\n- I was struck by the grandeur of the funeral, rare in recent times. There were twenty or thirty wreaths, baskets of flowers, and floral arrangements, all from anonymous donors. When I inquired, I was told that they were mainly individuals or organizations belonging to the more modest class of medium and small businessmen.\n\nThis seems to have made an impression on the right-wing traditionalists. Honma Ken'ichiro, a representative of this group, describes Nakano's death as a 'redemptive ablution,' continuing with the words:\n\n- Our offering in his memory is to continue his struggle to expel the bureaucrats as a rearguard. What purpose would the repetition of sutras by thousands or myriads of monks serve? Even if we lit incense torches and offered a whole forest of flowers in sacrifice, Nakano would not be satisfied. Blood can only be redeemed by blood."

NW_JAP.581.a: "Yes, we will pardon them"
NW_JAP.581.b: "No, they have committed too grave a crime"
NW_JAP.581 .c: "And who are they?"
NW_JAP.582.t: "Ishiwara's Character"
NW_JAP.582.d: "Despite his sharp analytical mind and strategic thinking, Ishiwara's weakness lies elsewhere: he has difficult relationships even with his closest circle, not to mention his rivals and competitors. Even those for whom he felt no animosity sometimes found it difficult to communicate with him. 'Conversations with Ishiwara,' recalled one of his acquaintances, 'often resembled a Zen-style question-and-answer session. In response to the most serious questions asked, he would often slap his palm on his smoothly shaven head, stick out his tongue, or make faces, giving no answer.' And although he could be cheerful and relaxed, his general abstinence meant that he usually had neither the inclination nor the opportunity for the combination of camaraderie and backroom politics so characteristic of restaurant gatherings and so beloved by most Japanese military personnel."
NW_JAP.582.a: "An interesting man"
NW_JAP.583.t: "Approval and Criticism of Ishiwara's Ideas"
NW_JAP.583.d: "Ishiwara's ideas in support of the true independence of Asian states found a response among the progressive members of Prince Konoe's think tank, the Koain, the Council for the Development of Asia, and even Konoe himself. However, for the idea of the East Asian League to be massively accepted in Japan, Ishiwara and his followers must recognize Japan as the leader of Asia. And on the other hand, this becomes a stumbling block in attempts to gain support for the idea of the East Asian League on mainland Asia. No matter how attractive it was outside of Japan, it was based on Ishiwara's assertion that it should become a 'federation of equal and politically independent Asian nations.' For nationalist critics in Japan, such a proposal is dangerously close to promoting the kind of internationalism that Japan has strongly opposed in recent years. Such critics believe that in name and content, this whole idea has a disgusting resemblance to the League of Nations, and, like that organization, it seemed to presuppose the existence of a supranational system above Japan. As such, it raised heretical questions about the supremacy of the kokutai and the position of the emperor. Moreover, in its emphasis on the racial issue and political independence, Ishiwara's proposal, in their opinion, opened up dangerous possibilities for the secession of Taiwan and Korea from Japan. All these arguments became a powerful reason for a flurry of criticism against Ishiwara's plans and the movement that supported him."

NW_JAP.584.t: "To All Officers and Men of the Imperial Army"
NW_JAP.584.d.a: "Ishiwara had long encountered the arrogant attitude of his colleagues and many Japanese towards other Asians, especially the Chinese. This was particularly evident after the creation of Manchukuo, when the new state turned out to be far from the ideal of 'racial harmony,' but rather resembled European colonies in which the role of Europeans was taken by Ishiwara's comrades in the officer corps of the Imperial Army. To combat this, it was decided to distribute a circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' throughout the army as part of an effort to restore moral discipline in the Japanese troops. The circular stated that cruel actions against the civilian population demeaned the dignity of the Japanese army and pointed to the need to ensure 'sincere cooperation between Japan and the Asian peoples.'"

Ishiwara and his circle had already tried to improve this situation, but they met with resistance from other army officers. Now they were able to distribute the circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' throughout the army, including to ordinary soldiers. The circular stated that cruel actions against the civilian population demeaned the dignity of the Japanese army and pointed to the need to ensure 'sincere cooperation between the two peoples of Japan and Asia.'"

NW_JAP.585.t: "Condemnation of Political Persecution and Military Intervention" 
NW_JAP.585.d: "Kanji Ishiwara, unexpectedly even for many of his supporters, condemned the government's persecution of political opponents with the help of the secret police and especially emphasized the danger of military intervention in the work of the government. This is doubly unusual to hear from a senior officer, but apparently he was strongly influenced by the difficulties he encountered during the development of his East Asian League Movement, and earlier in Manchukuo, where he saw the reality of when his military colleagues were trusted to run the country."

NW_JAP.586.t: "The Housing Problem"
NW_JAP.586.d: "In the new type of society that Ishiwara envisions, housing would, of course, be a crucial factor. His solution was to house people in large, hotel-like buildings, where the family would be the basic unit of social organization, and elderly relatives living in the same building would be a source of emotional support, not a burden. In this sense, Ishiwara believes he has discovered a system of life that, in his opinion, would combine the best aspects of filial piety and individual freedom.\n\n- We can, at least, realize a common destiny that will unite today's Japanese family with the agriculture of tomorrow, giving rise to an ideal that goes beyond blood kinship and leads to a stable economic existence and a spiritual life without conflict, Ishiwara said in one of his speeches on this topic."
NW_JAP.586.a: "Ishiwara invented mass housing development"
NW_JAP.587.t: "Problems of Communal Factories"
NW_JAP.587.d: "Ishiwara's ideas about moving industry to the villages, and their integration with cities, as well as the elimination of giant factories, are faced with a harsh reality that some experts warned about: work in such 'small enterprises' turns out to be not only extremely inefficient, but also to some extent useless. It turned out that the main problem is that it is impossible to achieve the required level of product quality if it is produced not in special large factories, but in separate small rural factories (for example, an attempt to produce steel in rural factories led to the fact that the steel obtained in village blast furnaces fell apart in their hands). There is a shortage of specialized personnel who previously had the opportunity to control everything while being at one factory, as well as equipment. In addition, there were difficulties with logistics: it turned out to be monstrously overloaded and there was a shortage of vehicles, as now it is necessary to transport much more products over long distances between small enterprises scattered at least within one region."
NW_JAP.587.a: "It seems even geniuses make mistakes"
NW_JAP.588.t: "Showa Restoration Plan"
NW_JAP.588.d: "Ishiwara has published his new work, titled 'Showa Restoration Plan.' In it, he took the original concept of the Showa Restoration as the basis for internal reform in Japan and expanded it to include reform in East Asia. Ishiwara argues that the Meiji Restoration was a Japanese restoration, carried out with the aim of overthrowing feudalism and creating a racial state centered on the emperor. The Showa Restoration, although it initially entailed radical changes in Japan, was to become an Asian restoration, uniting all Asian races. This would unite their devotion to a common set of moral values in a racial union to fight for the eradication of two hundred years of humiliation by the West. This struggle, the Final War, would lead to the restoration of peace, to a new unification of all races on the basis of the principle of the 'righteous way.'\n\nIn it, Ishiwara also outlined the essence of his reflections over two decades: his analysis of a protracted and decisive war, his view of battle as a geometric progression, the growing cruelty of the conflict, the clash of East and West, and the apocalyptic prophecy of Nichiren. To this he added several new assumptions. One of them was the assertion that the world had entered a 'second industrial revolution,' made possible by the fantastic achievements of science, especially in the field of electrochemistry (pioneered at the time by the Germans), which would allow the production of unprecedented sources of energy for both industrial production and the production of military weapons. Ishiwara told his audience that such discoveries would allow Asian countries to catch up with and, ultimately, surpass the West in productive and destructive power.\n\nMore important was his new focus on East Asia. The League, which was to be revived as a result of the reforms of the Showa Restoration, transformations aimed at the progress and liberation of all of Asia. Thus, the Showa Restoration included not only political reforms, but also national defense at home, as well as Pan-Asianism abroad. The East Asian League that it was to give rise to was to become a 'federation' of equal states, united to overthrow Western oppression by force of arms. However, the League itself was to be based on moral values, not on coercion. Once Asia defeated the West, its principles of harmony and cooperation, the 'righteous way,' could be extended to the whole world, and the 'eight corners of the world under one roof' could finally become a reality."

NW_JAP.589.t: "Ishiwara's Promotion"
NW_JAP.589.d: "Kanji Ishiwara has been transferred to a new position within the General Staff and promoted to the rank of major general. His other supporters have also received new appointments, so that now Ishiwara will not be able to influence the policy of our government so much, but at the same time his skills of strategic thinking will have the opportunity for realization."
NW_JAP.589.a: "We hope that in his new position he will apply his best qualities and will not interfere"
NW_JAP.590.t: "Criticism of Mein Kampf"
NW_JAP.590.d: "Recently, Ishiwara made a new speech in which he criticized the book 'Mein Kampf' by the Nazi ideologue, Adolf Hitler. For many years, a certain cult has developed around the Nazis in Japan; from afar, from the other end of the world, they seem to many to be the most progressive and modern political force, capable of building a great state. Many politicians have adopted their methods of political struggle, and even Ishiwara himself has expressed some admiration for Hitler as the new 'Napoleon of Europe.' However, recently Ishiwara decided to better understand their ideology and expressed doubts about the correctness of their ideas. In particular, he warned against Japan adopting a position of racial purity that would exclude Koreans. Ishiwara argued that Hitler had made a biological mistake in believing that Germans and Jews were different biological species, when in fact they were more like varieties of the same species. In addition, racially pure peoples, such as the tribes of Native Americans, were in practice weak. In contrast, the Japanese, Ishiwara argues, are of 'mixed blood,' and therefore are a strong people."
NW_JAP.590.a: "An unexpected blow to the cult of the Nazis"
NW_JAP.591.t: "Ishiwara's Reflections on the Power of Arms" 
NW_JAP.591.d: "The most important news of recent weeks, the beginning of the atomic age of mankind and the use of the first nuclear bomb, could not but remain without Ishiwara's attention. For some time he pondered, studying the consequences of the nuclear strike, which reached Japan both through open channels and through intelligence. Despite the fact that he himself had long predicted the appearance of this particular type of weapon, even he did not expect what kind of power it would be, and most importantly, what destruction and suffering it would bring. In the weeks that have passed, there is information about many people dying days later from the consequences of the nuclear explosion, radiation sickness.\n\nOn the one hand, according to Ishiwara's ideas, the appearance of a new, more destructive type of weapon should bring the beginning of the Final War closer, but now he began to think more often that it is possible to achieve the victory of the East over the West in other ways, and not just by direct military confrontation with the use of such monstrous new types of weapons."

NW_JAP.592.t: "Ishiwara's Grave Condition"
NW_JAP.592.d: "Ishiwara has become even more incapacitated due to a recurrence of a painful internal ailment caused by an old injury received during the Manchurian campaign. His condition has deteriorated so much that he was forced to move to a hospital in Tokyo for surgery and medical care. It is likely that he will no longer be able to perform the duties of prime minister, so he is going to hand over this post to one of his supporters, and after his recovery he will return to the role of spiritual leader of the East Asian League Movement."

NW_JAP.593.t: "Ishiwara's New Reflections on Agriculture"
NW_JAP.593.d: "For the few remaining years of his life, bedridden, Ishiwara spends his time in semi-mystical reflections, as well as in spreading his theories of agricultural self-sufficiency among those followers who have gathered in Nishiyama to be with him. In his speech on 'Creating a New Japan,' Ishiwara touched upon the possibilities of shifting Japan's focus from industrialization and from centralized urbanism to decentralized and self-sufficient rural units. In particular, he developed the idea of 'returning to the land,' a concept that was in many ways similar to the ideas of the 'agrarian movement' of the 30s, and in particular the agrarian theorist Gondo Seikei. In Ishiwara's approach, special attention was paid to the resettlement of the population in rural areas, the government's encouragement of small local enterprises, the opening of new lands for cultivation, and the development of new methods of farming, in particular, through the use of yeast fertilizers."
NW_JAP.593.a: "Yes, these are valuable remarks"
NW_JAP.594.t: "Ishiwara's New Ideological Positions"
NW_JAP.594.d: "More than anything else, recent years have been marked by a gradual weakening of Ishiwara's ideas, which were laid down in his concept of the Final War. The other day, he completely switched to a position of pacifism. Ishiwara decided to record his next address on tape, in the format of an interview. In it, he stated:\n\n- We must completely renounce war. We must resolutely avoid issues related to interests and benefits, and judge our national policy solely in the spirit of righteousness. Japan may be devastated because of a possible war, so we must live by completely rejecting war. The nation must gather, like Nichiren at Takenoguchi or Christ on the way to the crucifixion.\n\nTakenoguchi is a place in the city of Kamakura, designated for the execution of the monk Nichiren, the founder of this Buddhist school. It is possible that the spread of this idea undermines the ideas of the East Asian League movement too much, and we should limit its spread, citing Ishiwara's poor health in recent months and the clouding of his mind."

NW_JAP.594.b: "Yes, we must limit society from such statements"
NW_JAP.595.t: "Ishiwara's Last Message"
NW_JAP.595.d: "Experiencing constant pain from his chronic ailment, Ishiwara struggled all winter and spring of this year. Then, in the summer, a severe cold he caught developed into severe pneumonia. Realizing that his death was near, Ishiwara dictated a message the other day in which he summed up all his reflections of recent years about his country and its future. Ishiwara began by reviewing his point of view that in modern history there was first a transition from absolutism to liberalism, and by this he obviously meant laissez-faire liberalism, and then to a system of state planning, which he called a system of 'control.' Each of these systems represented a higher level of efficiency, with the most effective, in his opinion, being the system of the controlling state, since it arose as a dialectical synthesis of absolutism and liberalism. Probably because of his substantial confusion between the system of economic control and the system of political management, Ishiwara had to make a lot of effort to prove that the idea of planning, which was central to the control state he was talking about, was not identical to totalitarianism, as it had come to be understood in recent times."
NW_JAP.595.a: "We must spread this message"
NW_JAP.595.b: "In his dying speeches, Ishiwara is going too far"
NW_JAP.596.t: "The Dangers of Group Despotism"
NW_JAP.596.d: "In a note that he attached to his memorandum a few weeks later, Ishiwara emphasized that although Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union had embarked on the path of state control, they soon fell victim to 'group despotism,' in which all decisions were made by a few people in the center. But their perversion of the original concept in no way made it invalid or incompatible with democracy or personal freedom, Ishiwara insisted. In fact, he argued, the control system was part of a broad world trend in which the maximum degree of freedom was preserved within a system of general planning. Thus, even democratic states had moved to a control system. As an example, he cited the 'New Deal' program in the United States. In his July memorandum, Ishiwara pointed out that he believed that true liberalism (in the sense of non-interference) no longer existed anywhere, even in the United States."
NW_JAP.596.a: "These are the right words"
NW_JAP.596.b: "In the current situation, we cannot allow the spread of such thoughts"
NW_JAP.597.t: "Regional Specifics"
NW_JAP.597.d: "Turning to the justification of the concept of the East Asian League, Ishiwara noted that the development of a system of state planning throughout the world must take into account regional differences. Thus, the Japanese system of government would be Asian in ideology and character (an assertion that allowed him to preserve the Asian idea of the 'righteous way' as the fundamental principle of the state). 'The world must develop through cooperation between globalism and regionalism,' Ishiwara stated, and therefore East Asian unity, based on common cultural ties, became a step on the path to world peace. But it was the East Asian League that offered the most practical and innovative plan for the unification of East Asia compared to other competitors, both within Japan and beyond its borders."

NW_JAP.598.desc.a: "For the last two weeks, Kanji Ishiwara's pneumonia has become terminal, and his closest followers have gathered around the small house where he was dying. He asked that Buddhist prayers be read for him. Another famous pan-Asianist ideologue, Okawa ShQmei, also arrived when he was informed of Ishiwara's dying condition. It is said that at the end, Ishiwara expressed satisfaction that he was leaving this world at the age of sixty-one, the same age at which Nichiren, the founder of the religious movement that Ishiwara had followed for so many years, died. In Japan, it is traditional to count a person's age as one year older, so at birth he is immediately one year old. Because of this, in the European manner, Ishiwara would only be 60 years old."
NW_JAP.598.desc.b: "$NW_JAP.598.desc.a$\n\nThe death of Ishiwara has upset the delicate balance in the structure of the East Asian League, as previously it was Ishiwara, even sick and almost incapacitated, who remained the most legitimate leader and the most popular figure of the movement, despite the fact that the post of prime minister has been held by for several years. All decisions were considered to be made with Ishiwara's approval, although recently, due to the deterioration of his health, he has hardly participated in state work, and his closest assistants, secretaries, and friends have begun to play a greater role.

NW_JAP.599.d.a: "In the last month, Ishiwara's influence has fallen so low that, with the exception of Kawabe Torashiro and one or two other people, few even in the operations department of the General Staff followed his example. As genro Saionji told Prince Konoe, Ishiwara had become simply a 'nuisance' to the Umezu-Terauchi group: 'He is like a candle in the wind, ready to go out at any moment.' The necessary gust of wind was not long in coming. The other day, when Ishiwara's effectiveness was at zero, he was removed from his post in the General Staff. The victory of Sugiyama and Umezu seems complete.\n\nAlthough this is not entirely true. The people who are replacing Ishiwara in his post are also part of the group of moderate officers of the Imperial Army seeking a diplomatic resolution to the conflict that has begun, so it looks more like getting rid of a general who has become too useless and toxic for his entourage."

NW_JAP.600.t: "The Return of Ishiwara"
NW_JAP.600.d: "Kanji Ishiwara, the man thanks to whom Manchukuo got a chance to be born, returns to his original creation, from whose leadership he was excluded at the very beginning of its formation in 1932. Then he was an insignificant colonel, who, although he managed to gain influence over the headquarters of the Kwantung Army, was nothing more than that. Over the past years, fate has managed to raise him to incredible heights, practically bringing him to the role of the gray cardinal of the Japanese government, but after a series of political failures and the failure of his policy of detente and peace in relations with China, he was dismissed from the General Staff and sent to the post of deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army. Now he is in the rank of major general, but his reputation is severely damaged, and his actual position does not have the important tools of control, so he will be severely limited in his ability to bring Manchukuo to the ideal that he was fired up with when he created it several years ago."

NW_JAP.601.d: "When Ishiwara arrived in Manchuria, his position at the headquarters of the Kwantung Army and his ability to effect any real change had already been weakened by the failure of his local reformist allies. Nevertheless, since his interests were similar and since he treated them with such passion, he eventually re-established contact with this group and made their struggle his own. On an official level, Ishiwara tries to convey his views through a constant stream of memorandums to the command of the Kwantung Army, in which he sharply criticizes the current situation in Manchuria and gives energetic recommendations for making clear changes in policy. From these messages, several general themes of Ishiwara's disagreement can be identified. The main ones were the following memorandums: 'Recommendations for defense against a Soviet invasion'; 'Demands for the abolition of the internal leadership of Manchukuo'; 'On the abolition of the internal leadership of Manchukuo'; 'The guiding authority of the commander of the Kwantung Army'; 'Opinion regarding the army's withdrawal from politics.'"

NW_JAP.603.d: "The situation with Ishiwara eloquently testifies to the surprising tolerance of the Japanese military system for acts of insubordination, as none of these incidents led to Ishiwara's arrest and court-martial. This is all considered a manifestation of the very gekokujo, the spirit of insubordination of juniors to seniors. Be that as it may, Ishiwara's frantic behavior and his connections with 'subversive' reformist elements both in Manchuria and in Japan led to his complete isolation at the headquarters of the Kwantung Army. Despite the departure of some of his direct opponents from the leadership, such as General Tojo, who held the post of Chief of the General Staff of the Kwantung, his successor, General Rensuke Isogai, a former ally of Ishiwara, found it prudent to stay away from him, as did other old friends like Colonel Tadashi Katakura, now working in the Special Services Bureau. Ishiwara's enemies, of course, were caustic in their remarks. One of them, Masahiko Amakasu, now one of the leaders of the Concordia Association, gave Ishiwara his scathing comment, telling him to his face that his continued presence was no longer in the interests of Manchukuo. By today, Ishiwara has become a universal disgrace, as a result of which the Chief of Staff of the Army, Korechika Anami, and concurrently his friend, noted in his diary the other day that the 'Ishiwara problem' was one of his biggest headaches."

NW_JAP.604.desc.a: "Discouraged by his precarious position in the army, dissatisfied with what he considered Japan's pernicious influence in Asia, and again suffering from a bout of illness, General Ishiwara decided to leave Manchukuo and the Kwantung Army before he was kicked out. The very process by which he tried to do this became the subject of fierce debate. Ishiwara submitted an application to the Ministry of War, where he was told that to be enrolled in the reserve, the matter had to be approved by the Minister of War, but in the meantime he was allowed to return to Japan on sick leave.\n\nHowever, the leadership of the Kwantung Army insists that Ishiwara left it without any permission, that one day he simply got up from his desk and left Manchuria not in military uniform, but in the dark olive uniform of the Concordia Association. Ishiwara's departure caused discontent in the command of the Kwantung Army, and an officer was sent to Tokyo to inform the Minister of War of Ishiwara's behavior. However, neither he nor his deputy made any attempt to summon the troublesome general once he arrived in Tokyo."

But still, the day before all the transfer orders were published, Tojo managed to conduct one last check on Ishiwara. He ordered the commander of the Kempeitai special service, Colonel Keijiro Etani, to conduct a lightning raid on the Tokyo offices of the Concordia Association, which led to the arrest of Kenzo Asahara and others on charges of undermining discipline in the army."

All this will be in anticipation of the coming 'final war.' In Manchuria, the League is just beginning to enjoy the fruits of active support from local Japanese groups scattered throughout the region, hoping to restore previous claims of racial harmony. The commander of the China Expeditionary Army has sent the command of the Kwantung Army a copy of the circular 'To All Officers and Men of the Expeditionary Army' as part of an effort to restore moral discipline in the Japanese occupation forces, hoping to enlist its support for a joint Sino-Manchurian statement of support for the East Asian League."

This program of personal attacks culminated in a speech Ishiwara gave at Kyoto University on the problems of East Asia. Ishiwara told his audience, which included the governor of Kyoto Prefecture:\n\n- The enemy is not the Chinese people, but rather some Japanese.

However, this idea was strongly opposed by General Korechika Anami, the Army Vice Minister, who highly valued Ishiwara's outstanding talent. Anami's behavior changed dramatically from his usual meek demeanor and neutral status, and he said: 'Having General Ishiwara in the reserve is a loss for the army itself. If we force such a talented man into the reserve, it will cause unnecessary friction.' He publicly argued with Tojo at the War Ministry, and they had a heated argument in front of other officers. Anami even relied on his connections with Prince Naruhiko, a member of the imperial family and an army general who is fond of Ishiwara, to try to reverse Tojo's arbitrary personnel changes. Finally, Anami said he would resign as Vice Minister if Ishiwara was sent to the reserve."

However, at the beginning of the meeting, Ishiwara suddenly told Tojo: 'You are incompetent to wage war or govern the country, so please resign immediately,' which angered the Prime Minister, and the meeting ended in vain."

The other day, he was interrogated by several Kempeitai officers at his home. They asked him why he opposed Tojo. Ishiwara replied that it was foolish to think that he, just an old retired soldier with no power or influence, could 'oppose' Tojo, who was both War Minister and Prime Minister of Japan. When the Kempeitai officers insisted that the heart of the problem was that his ideas contradicted Tojo's, Ishiwara retorted:\n\n- That is even more insane. Of course, I have ideas.

This news came as no surprise to those who understood the views of the individuals who now lead, or rather led, the now-former Seiyukai. However, it cannot be said that the dissolution was painless; a portion of the party's deputies, led by Ichiro Hatoyama, a failed party leader but one with a group of close supporters, protested the leadership's decision and stated that in that case, they were ready to form a new party."

However, even without the split, there were too many supporters of dissolution within the Seiyukai; the only faction resisting this outcome is Hatoyama's circle with the old liberals of the party, but they had too little power and even they ultimately agreed to dissolve 'their' Seiyukai, following the Nakajima faction and the neutral faction, which is most actively participating in the dissolution movement."

One of them commented that the new party's mission is to 'realize a unified nation and a one-party system with the aim of mobilizing the entire nation,' and that 'this is an attempt to distinguish itself from traditional parliamentary parties.' The concept of 'One Nation, One Party' was apparently influenced by the National Socialist rule in Germany, but it also states that 'we will be loyal and responsible to our great Japanese Emperor,' which led him to further comment that 'Hitler could become a dictator in both name and substance, but in Japan, as long as we recognize the existence of the Emperor, there is no possibility for a dictator to become a dictator.'"

I hereby create the Great Japan Youth Party and pledge to dedicate myself to supporting the great cause of the Showa Restoration. I pray that the gods grant us their protection.\n\nThe 'White Sun, Red Flag of Sincerity' was named in honor of this and symbolized unity with the Emperor, as a similar banner was used by the imperial army during the Meiji Restoration. The party was named the 'Great Japan Youth Party,' and as the name suggests, it is primarily aimed at young people and is modeled after the Hitler Youth of the German Reich. This went so far as to even borrow the light brown color for the members' uniforms.

It spread poison within a 50-meter radius, and the prime minister and his driver died within minutes. The assassin turned out to be the most famous and strongest Japanese judoka, Masahiko Kimura, who tried to flee the scene, but since he had to climb down from the tree from which he threw the bomb, it took too long, and he received a large dose of gas, but has so far survived and been hospitalized. The military police have begun a search for suspects, as it is unlikely he could have done this alone; at the very least, he must have obtained this secret military weapon from somewhere. It is already known that Kimura was a student of another famous judoka, Tatsukuma Ushijima, and the retired General Kanji Ishiwara, a long-time opponent of Prime Minister Tojo.

In the unit under his command, he even distributed special brochures in which he wrote, to raise the soldiers' morale, to 'imagine the enemy as the man who killed their father, and that they are coming to take just revenge on him.'

For example, special attention was given to the status of a prisoner; formally, the Code specifically forbade retreat or surrender: 'Never live to experience the shame of a prisoner.'

Today, Sugawara prepared the inspection group's report, which concluded that air defense is the responsibility of the air force, which is well acquainted with the characteristics of aircraft; that civilian air defense should also be strengthened by increasing the number of anti-aircraft guns, and that it is impossible to use a large number of aircraft for air defense.\n\nUpon returning to Japan, Sugawara, along with Kanji Ishiwara, chief of the operations department of the Army General Staff, who was his best friend and classmate from the Sendai Military Academy, and Colonel Kazumoto Machijiri, chief of the military affairs department of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, submitted a petition to the General Staff, urging to 'emphasize aviation.' However, the General Staff, unable to completely abandon its 'infantry first' philosophy due to its rigidity, gave an ambiguous answer: 'aviation is a priority, but ground forces are absolute.'\n\nSugawara was disappointed that the army considered aviation a branch of the military responsible only for field battles, and believed that the navy, which had shifted its focus to aviation, was three years behind the army. When the navy asked him to clarify the details of his inspection in Germany, he officially proposed to the navy to create an independent air force in Japan, combining the army and navy aviation, similar to the Luftwaffe. In response to Sugawara's proposal, the Navy decided to reject his advanced proposal, stating that 'the issue of an independent air force is premature, and the Navy does not support it,' for reasons such as the army's larger size and political influence, which meant that an independent air force would likely be under the army's control, and that they did not want the Navy's aviation to be absorbed by the army's aviation, which was inferior in terms of technology and military tactics."

In addition, he was later tainted by his neutral support for the military conspirators of February 26, which cost him his post. All this ultimately led Japan to withdraw from the London Naval Treaty, but most importantly, the navy lost valuable personnel who were also opponents of a war with the USA and Britain. Okada himself is a prime example of the Treaty Faction, and now, to strengthen his position, he wants to bring his comrades back into service.\n\nA major role in the navy's command is played by the imperial prince Fushimi, who is a supporter of the Fleet Faction and on whose initiative the purges were carried out. However, at that time, this was due to the fierce opposition to the continuation of the London Treaty, and since we have now withdrawn from it, we should perhaps hold negotiations with the naval leaders so that the return of representatives of the Treaty Faction does not look like a conspiracy behind the backs of other naval officers."

The answer to this task was the idea of uniting the democratic (and not only) right-wing forces into a single party, repeating the path of the ruling party itself, which arose from the unification of various left-wing and near-left movements. This idea was led by Ichiro Hatoyama, once the head of one of the factions of the Rikken Seiyukai, and now the 'first among equals' in the new Dokokai party. Almost all the remnants and heirs of the Seiyukai and Minseito have poured into it, so the new party also has a special committee consisting of all the leaders of the former parties, strictly controlling Hatoyama.

Feeling such powerful support and the legitimacy of their ideas, this will allow the social democrats to restore their position in the party, which had previously been sagging due to the dominance of the totalitarian concepts of the national socialists. It is not surprising that the zaibatsu have also joined this game; the reforms of the social democrats are the 'lesser of two evils' in the current political situation, as the most radical ideas of the national socialists involve establishing direct control over large-scale industry. The only force among the 'elite groups' that has so far remained neutral is the Imperial Navy.

With the socialists coming to power in Japan, this cooperation was renewed with new vigor. Moreover, many analysts point out a surprising similarity between some of the provisions of Sun Yat-sen's ideology and that of the Japanese socialists, especially the national socialist faction.

In addition, the houses are distinguished by their appearance - they are built in the constructivist style that appeared in the 20s in Germany and the Soviet Union.

His touching works about the lives of ordinary people, criticizing large capitalists and emphasizing the importance of peasants and ordinary city dwellers, have had wide success throughout the Empire.\n\nIn addition, a separate experiment is being conducted with the support of creating our own animation against the backdrop of the successes of American animators such as Walt Disney. The popularity of his color sound cartoons in our country irritates some particularly patriotic people, but this only speaks to the quality of his work. Previously, Japanese animators could not compete with the American giants, as they had to save money severely in the production of their pictures, but now they have the support of the government, and thanks to it, we will be able to create our own popular animation."
NW_JAP.667.a: "One day our films and animation will win the hearts of Americans too"
NW_JAP.668.t: "Support for Sports"
NW_JAP.668.d: "The party leader, Abe Isoo, is called the 'father of Japanese baseball,' because during his studies in America, he became addicted to this sport and, believing that 'knowledge is formed through study, and character through sport,' Abe dedicated himself to the spread and development of baseball, which had only recently appeared in Japan. In 1901, he became the first manager of the Waseda University baseball team and led the team on the first-ever overseas tour in the history of Japanese baseball, bringing with him numerous techniques and training methods used in America, the homeland of baseball. Abe and his team did not keep these secrets within the Waseda team, but instead spread them throughout Japan through books and instructions. This laid the foundation for the development of baseball techniques in Japan. Abe also founded the Dai Nippon Taiiku Kyokai (Great Japan Amateur Sports Association) along with Kano Jigoro and others. In 1930, he became the first president of the Big Six Tokyo baseball league (he resigned in 1932 when the Waseda University baseball club withdrew from the league). It was to be expected that the party he founded would actively invest in the development of sports, and so it happened: recently, a project to build stadiums has been launched in almost every prefecture, and not only for baseball, and additional sports classes with a diverse choice of disciplines are being introduced in schools."

The parliament building was taken under guard by detachments of young fighters of Kingoro Hashimoto, and the editorial offices of independent parties and newspapers were closed. The leaders of the parties were forced to dissolve their parties, although they were allowed to keep their seats in parliament.

NW_JAP.671.d: "The Japanese government is offering us a non-aggression pact with a secret clause concerning the division of China into spheres of influence. This is very unexpected on their part, as the Japanese Empire has always proclaimed its staunch anti-communism, and now they are ready to conclude a non-aggression pact right away. However, this is explained by the new parliamentary socialist government of the country, whose ideologues allow for coexistence with our country. In this way, they want to achieve control over the spread of communism in Asia."

He managed, in cooperation with the emperor's liberal circle, to restore the rule of party cabinets, but now it is time to give way to his successor. The party's top leadership must decide who will become the new party president."

NW_JAP.676.t: "The Army Secretly Supports Tohokai"
NW_JAP.676.d: "A group of deputies from the Tohokai party visited the location of one of the army units in Manchuria. Apparently, this was done at the instigation of both the party leader, Seigo Nakano, who often went on such trips himself to get 'field reports,' and with the support of the army leadership, which is now in the hands of his friend, the leader of the Manchurian faction, Kanji Ishiwara. There are also rumors that the army has begun to secretly allocate funding from its funds for the Tohokai party against the backdrop of the return of party cabinets, in order to strengthen the influence of 'their people' in the next elections."
NW_JAP.676.a: "They are twisting and turning as much as they can to get to power" 
NW_JAP.677.t: "Confirmation of Rikken Seiyukai's Previous Ties"
NW_JAP.677.d: "It has become known that the army leaders, feeling that they cannot directly take power in the country, have decided to return to the 'new old' strategy of political participation - developing ties with convenient parliamentary parties. The Rikken Seiyukai, led by the owner of an aviation corporation, Chikuhei Nakajima, has finally become such a party. The party promotes pro-war populist slogans and, according to some information, receives funding from the army. On the other hand, why would a party associated with several zaibatsu take additional money from the generals."
NW_JAP.677.a: "This takes us back 10 years"
NW_JAP.678.t: "Ties between the Army and Shakai Taishuto"
NW_JAP.678.d: "Starting with the publication of the 'Army Pamphlet' in 1934, some deputies of the Shakai Taishuto party began to openly support the army in its aspirations to take power in the country. With each year, the degree of contact between these two initially seemingly distant forces began to intensify, so today it is not even surprising that the army openly supports this party. Perhaps the most important support that the Shakai Taishuto receives from them is secret funding, which is reported in the newspapers of the left's rivals."
NW_JAP.678.a: "Their ideas have indeed become similar"
NW_JAP.679.t: "Strengthening of the One-Party Movement"
NW_JAP.679.d: "The One-Party Movement is gaining momentum as the next parliamentary elections approach. Thanks to the fact that the Kakushin Shinto was headed by Prince Konoe himself, a figure popular among all strata of society, this party is gaining great popularity among the population."
NW_JAP.679.a: "A tough opponent"
NW_JAP.680.t: "Kuhara Headed the One-Party Movement"
NW_JAP.680.d: "The president of the original Rikken Seiyukai party, Fusanosuke Kuhara, during another conversation with journalists, made statements that he supports the One-Party Movement and even heads it in the current circumstances. It is hard to say whether this is good for us or not, as perhaps if this 'role' were taken by some other, less controversial figure, the Movement itself would have gained a larger scale."
NW_JAP.680.a: "It's good that Kuhara is the one leading them"
NW_JAP.681.t: "Kakushin Shinto Receives Support from the One-Party Movement" 
NW_JAP.681.d: "The New Innovation Party has successfully picked up the ideas of the One-Party Movement, and at the moment these two populist currents have successfully united to achieve a common goal - victory in the upcoming parliamentary elections. In general, this proves the correctness of those observers who spoke of the decline in popularity of the largest parliamentary parties against the backdrop of various corruption scandals."
NW_JAP.681.a: "A difficult situation"
NW_JAP.682.t: "Tohokai Receives Support from Supporters of the One-Party Movement"
NW_JAP.682.d: "Seigo Nakano still managed to skillfully use the One-Party Movement, having agreed with its leaders to support his party in the upcoming parliamentary elections. This will probably allow Nakano to dramatically improve the position of his faction and pave the way for the long-awaited premiership. Once Nakano was part of the Rikken Minseito, but now he has possibly become one of the main rivals of his original party."
NW_JAP.682.a: "However, Nakano couldn't get along in the Kokumin Domei party either"

NW_JAP.684.t: "Ryutaro's Approach is Approved"
NW_JAP.684.d: "Ryutaro's bet on the party's pro-war agitation has had its success - against the backdrop of military operations, this has indeed gained popularity among the people. It is worth noting that this is still playing with fire, but he who does not risk does not drink champagne."
NW_JAP.684.a: "We will continue to move in this direction"
NW_JAP.685.t: "Exclusion of Nakajima"
NW_JAP.685.d: "Nakajima's faction has long hindered the stable work of the party. It has long personally prevented Hatoyama from leading the party. Now that Hatoyama's authority as the winner of the parliamentary elections is indisputable, he can realize his long-standing plan to get rid of Nakajima and his supporters. This will lead to the loss of deputies from the party in the Diet, but during the existence of his government, he will be able to recover this loss."
NW_JAP.685.a: "Goodbye, Mr. Nakajima"
NW_JAP.686.t: "Carefree Papa"
NW_JAP.686.d: "Shortly after the Great Kanto Earthquake, the editor-in-chief of the Hochi Shimbun thought about publishing a cheerful comic strip in his newspaper and chose the work of a budding cartoonist, Yutaka Aso, who had the idea for an eight-panel comic 'Carefree Papa' about an unemployed man, Nonkin Tosan, who struggles to find a job, sometimes working as a policeman, actor, or announcer, but always returning to his life of poverty. The prototype for the idea was the extremely popular American comic strip 'Bringing Up Father,' which was published by the Asahi newspaper, and at first, the young artist refused to even try to publish his work, as he believed it was impossible to compete with such a famous comic, but in the end, it was the series about Nonkin-san that became a bestseller and surpassed its American progenitor in popularity - so much so that several short animated films were even made about him and a large-scale release of advertising and goods under the 'Carefree Papa' brand began. A new term even arose: men with a carefree demeanor began to be called 'nontu.'\n\nWith the growing fame of Prime Minister Machida Chuji, more and more people began to talk about the striking external resemblance of the head of the cabinet to the main character of the comic, but no one should be surprised -Chuji was the president of the Hochi Shimbun newspaper when it began publishing this comic, so perhaps the artist had a direct image for inspiration. Now, following the favorite habit of the Japanese people, the prime minister has been nicknamed Nonkin Tosan, or Carefree Papa."
NW_JAP.686.a: "The Carefree Premier"
NW_JAP.687.t: "Ero-guro-nansensu"
NW_JAP.687.d: "After the start of the Great Depression, a cultural movement emerged in the cities, taking its name from the Anglo-Japanese words 'erotic,' 'grotesque,' and 'nonsense.' Since then, there has been a boom in books, magazines, newspaper articles, and music with erotic, grotesque, and absurd themes, published in large quantities by newspapers and publishing houses. Chief editors, explaining the reasons for agreeing to publish these materials, state that they are trying to help people forget about the problems of daily life and politics, which since 1931 have taken over the front pages of newspapers and which people have grown tired of. On the other hand, some suggest that this was facilitated by the publication in Japan of the complete works of Sigmund Freud on the eve of the Great Depression, but other analysts see the origins of 'ero-guro-nansensu' in the Japanese culture of previous centuries."
NW_JAP.687.a: "This is another example of moral decline"
NW_JAP.688.t: "The Pink Dispute"
NW_JAP.688.d: "Against the backdrop of the strengthening left-wing movement in those years, the Ministry of Home Affairs did not interfere with the spread of such life trends, claiming that 'eroticism is better than terrorism' and 'if you're going to be painted red, it's better to be pink.' One of the striking examples of this perversion was the 'pink dispute,' a labor conflict that arose in 1933 between the female troupe of the Shochiku Girls' Revue and their employer, the Shochiku Musical Theatre company, which tried to cut some musicians and reduce the salaries of the rest. The central figure and leader of the girls' strike was the 18-year-old actress Takiko Mizunoe, who, along with 60 other girls, organized a strike against their management. Despite a brief arrest, they managed to defend their demands, and it is believed that public support, thanks to newspapers that eagerly printed news about the ongoing conflict, played a special role."
NW_JAP.688.a: "Overall, this is an effective way to pervert the left-wing idea."
NW_JAP.689.t: "Ero-Pop"
NW_JAP.689.d: "Also during this period, a music genre known as 'Nee Kouta' became popular. This boom began with the 1929 song 'Aishite Chodai' ('Love Me, Please') by singer Chiyako Sato, which sings: 'Hey, hey, please love me.' Sato became the first singer to record her songs on records. Due to its provocative lyrics, this genre is also called 'ero-kayo' ('erotic pop'). In the early years, there were no laws regulating audio recordings, so music became an active channel for spreading eroticism. However, in 1934, the publishing legislation was revised, giving the government ways to control this market as well. The song 'Wasurecha Iya yo' by Hamako Watanabe, released in March of that year, became particularly popular, possibly against the backdrop of the Sada Abe scandal. Audio records of this song are currently being prepared for release, and it is possible that we should ban this song as extremely erotic."
NW_JAP.689.a: "We must stop this decadence."
NW_JAP.689.b: "Let them read and listen to pink rather than red."
NW_JAP.690.t: "Underground Literature"
NW_JAP.690.d: "With the adoption of the Universal Manhood Suffrage Act and the flourishing of Taisho democracy, the publisher Kaizosha began to publish 'enpon'—books collecting contemporary Japanese literature sold for one yen to compensate for falling magazine sales. Soon, not only small and medium-sized but also large publishers followed their example, publishing cheap and accessible literature in the ero-guro-nansensu style in the enpon format. The liberal atmosphere of the time contributed to the development of a rebellious mood in the publishing industry, which ignored the censorship and bans imposed on their books. As usual, censorship was strict, and some publishers still practiced self-censorship, but some companies circumvented the law in various ways; for example, some attached a 'Table of Omitted Words' to their books so that the reader would understand what was being censored.\n\nTheoretically, a book banned by censorship could not enter the market. Nevertheless, many such books managed to bypass the authorities in various ways. 'Ero-guro-nansensu' literature acquired a reputation as 'underground' because it was distributed through secret book-selling clubs. One method of bypassing censorship was to conduct 'guerrilla sales,' where the released books were almost completely sold out before being submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs for inspection. A few copies of the books were specially kept for confiscation if the Ministry of Home Affairs deemed them unsuitable for publication. Thanks to police agents, we know that among the members of the book-selling clubs that distributed these works is the president of the Tokyo Bar Association, Kiyosaku Toyohara, as well as many other intellectuals of our time. To call such books 'underground' would be an exaggeration, as the scale of these operations was quite large.\n\nLarge publishing companies also engaged in guerrilla releases during this period. For example, in 1932, the company Heibonsha published an appendix to the 'Edogawa Ranpo ZenshQ' titled 'Hanzai Zukan,' which was immediately banned from sale for 'corrupting public morals.' The boom in the mass media of 'ero guro nansensu' inspired Heibonsha and other major publishers, such as Shinchosha, to release a large amount of banned content. It is possible that in the current political climate, we should keep a closer eye on the spread of such things."
NW_JAP.690.a: "Alright, we'll leave this outlet for the people."
NW_JAP.690.b: "We must put a stop to these attempts."
NW_JAP.691.t: "A Split in the Rikken Minseito"
NW_JAP.691.d: "The Rikken Minseito seemed almost an unbreakable monolith compared to its main rival, the Rikken SeiyQkai, where factional disputes were hardly possible. However, a series of recent setbacks for the party (such as losing the general election), as well as the personal rivalry between the two party leaders, Machida ChQji and RyQtaro Nagai, for the leadership position and, most importantly, for ideological dominance, have brought the Minseito to its current state. Officially, neither faction has made any statements after the recent party meeting, but it was held in a very heated manner, and it can be said that the party is on the brink of an abyss."
NW_JAP.691.a: "Perhaps this has its beneficiaries."
NW_JAP.692.t: "ChQji Resigns as Minseito Leader"
NW_JAP.692.d: "Machida ChQji turned out not to be as good a politician as it seemed during the period of national unity cabinets. However, as soon as he was entrusted with forming a government, the truth came out—he failed to lead the party to victory in the next election, which greatly damaged his intra-party image. In the end, understanding his responsibility for the failure, he decided not to cling to his post but to leave it voluntarily. Elections for a new leader were immediately announced, in which RyQtaro Nagai, his protege and the Minseito's general secretary, naturally won. Nagai is distinguished by his good oratorical skills, the art of intrigue, and ambitious foreign policy ideas."
NW_JAP.692.a: "RyQtaro may prove to be a more formidable opponent than his predecessor."
NW_JAP.693.t: "ChQji's Faction Leaves the Shinshinto"
NW_JAP.693.d: "The Rikken Minseito seemed to be at the peak of its greatness and influence, but the personal ambitions of its two leaders began to have a negative effect—RyQtaro Nagai's project to merge parties close to the Minseito into a new single organization did not yield the promised result. One could even say the opposite; in the elections, it led to a monstrous loss of votes for the new Shinshinto party, as old party supporters decided they could no longer support this party, and it failed to attract new ones, or gained too few. However, RyQtaro did not decide to admit his mistakes and did not resign, as was demanded by deputies close to Machida ChQji. As a result, the last party meeting of the Shinshinto ended with ChQji's faction leaving the new party. He gave no other messages or comments on this matter—apparently, what happened was a surprise to him, and he has not yet decided what to do next."
NW_JAP.693.a: "This is our chance to increase our number of deputies; we need to talk to ChQji."
NW_JAP.694.t: "Hatoyama's Son's Wedding"
NW_JAP.694.d: "Today in Tokyo, at the Imperial Hotel, one of the most lavish events of recent years took place, especially considering the current harsh circumstances, attended by many of the country's most noble and wealthy people. It was the wedding of Prime Minister Hatoyama's son, lichiro Hatoyama. He married Yasuko Ishibashi, the daughter of the owner of the Bridgestone Corporation, which produces tires. Despite rumors of the arranged nature of this wedding, the newlyweds looked happy, and indeed, lichiro and Yasuko met on their own while studying in high school a few years ago."

NW_JAP.696.d: "Hatoyama has served as party president for more than two terms, and so it is time for him to resign to maintain the traditional two-term rule for this position. This will allow the new leader of the Rikken SeiyQkai to take the post of Prime Minister after the upcoming elections. Several people are contenders for this role, primarily two of Hatoyama's closest supporters who have backed him for over 15 years. On the other hand, there is Hitoshi Ashida, a coalition candidate from Hatoyama's intra-party opponents, yet no less a staunch opponent of the military (and perhaps even more so) than Hatoyama himself."

NW_JAP.698.d: "To some extent, Chikuhei Nakajima entered the race for the presidency of the Rikken SeiyQkai not of his own will, but at the call of a large number of party members who expressed dissatisfaction with the figures of Suzuki and Hatoyama. They needed a unifying leader capable of challenging the old leadership. Now Nakajima wishes to leave his post, handing over the party leadership to someone else. In any case, the party's financial flows will remain predominantly in his hands."

NW_JAP.699.d: "In the recent parliamentary elections, Chikuhei Nakajima's Rikken SeiyQkai party won again, with a significant majority of deputies. Thanks to the system of financing candidates favorable to the party, built by Nakajima, as well as skillful work with the military, support from the Veterans' Association, and corresponding agitation, the SeiyQkai seems to have formed a new parliamentary era, already dubbed by journalists as the 'one-and-a-half party system,' in which one dominant party retains power, while others cannot gain enough popularity to form a cabinet. Other intra-elite groups, such as the reform bureaucrats, have also found their place in the SeiyQkai, occupying some leadership positions and government seats."

NW_JAP.702.t: "The Murdered Genius" 
NW_JAP.702.d: "Young officers viewed political leaders such as Hamaguchi Osachi, Inoue Junnosuke, Shidehara Kijuro, and Takahashi Korekiyo as men who put the interests of capitalist entrepreneurs and their own political parties above the needs of national unity and strength, as well as the economic well-being of the population. When Finance Minister Takahashi declared on November 27, 1935, in a widely publicized speech: 'If the military continues to unreasonably insist on increasing budgets, I think they will lose the trust of the people,' he signed his own death warrant.\n\nThe military assassins of February 26 rejected the idea that a finance minister, who they believed was responsible only to big business and party politicians, and not to the emperor and the nation, could think that the people trusted him more than the army. In fact, the rebel officers went so far as to blame Takahashi for urban unemployment and rural poverty at the very time his policies created full employment in the cities and led to a rise in the real value of agricultural products. Takahashi was considered by them to be anti-emperor, although, ironically, Takahashi's seaside villa in Hayama was next to the emperor's villa, and on weekends the finance minister often visited Hirohito to inform him on economic matters.\n\nBefore our eyes, what the conservatives, the military, and various conspirators feared is happening—Takahashi managed, before his assassination, to lay the foundations for the revival of the Japanese economy and the beginning of mass prosperity. The latest work of the prominent British economist John Maynard Keynes theoretically confirms Takahashi's practical actions as finance minister—the Japanese economy recovered thanks to his skillful leadership, not the seizure of Manchuria and the exploitation of its economy, as some critics of the minister claimed. Now our task is to clear the reputation of the great murdered minister and remind the people of who is behind the modern prosperity of the Japanese Empire, discrediting those who so fiercely attacked Takahashi all these years."
NW_JAP.702.a: "Takahashi was killed, but he prepared those who will continue his work." 
NW_JAP.703.t: "The Need for Imperial Intervention"
NW_JAP.703.d: "The last genro, Saionji, was always aware of his status as a descendant of the Fujiwara clan and, moreover, thanks to his close ties with the imperial family from a young age, he had a strong sense of 'protecting and preserving the imperial family,' which shaped his political position. For a long time, he continued to oppose the direct rule of the emperor, whose absolute power meant that mistakes were unacceptable. This became evident when, after Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi was reprimanded by Emperor Showa for the assassination of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin in 1928, and the cabinet resigned—Saionji opposed the emperor's reprimand, citing the consequences of the reprimand as a pretext for deposing the emperor. Some also attribute Saionji's influence in persuading Emperor Showa that 'as a constitutional monarch, I will not oppose the decisions of my subjects.' Ironically, this same position causes discontent among nationalists and reformers, who, on the contrary, wish for the monarch to take a greater part in political decisions. Saionji always tried to prevent the emperor's direct intervention in politics, which would weaken his position. For this reason, he often expressed concern about Emperor Showa's attempts to intervene in politics. However, recently, he has become more and more convinced of the need to express the will of the imperial court and suggested that direct descendants (for example, the emperor's brothers) should be one of the pillars of this will."
NW_JAP.703.a: "It seems even Saionji has realized that the country has reached the brink of an abyss."
NW_JAP.704.t: "Proposal for a New Fishing Convention"
NW_JAP.704.d: "The first intergovernmental agreement specifically dedicated to fisheries issues was the Fishing Convention concluded between Russia and Japan on July 15, 1907. Based on the Treaty of Portsmouth, it secured exceptionally broad rights for the use of the fish resources of the coastal areas of the Russian Far East. The Kamchatka fishing district, previously 'preserved' for Russia due to its remoteness, was 'unpreserved' for the Japanese.\n\nAt the beginning of the century, Russo-Japanese contacts in the field of fisheries were a complex combination of contradictions and cooperation. Russian fishermen, protecting their interests, tried with the help of the Priamurye Governor-Generalship to limit the extremely developed fishing activities of Japanese fishermen off the coast of Primorye. At the same time, it was difficult for Russian fish industrialists to do without Japanese fishing techniques and gear, purchased in Japan, and without Japanese sales markets, which by the beginning of the 20th century were one of the main ones for Russian fish exports in the Far East.\n\nIn 1925, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Japan, negotiations on fisheries began, which were difficult and continued until 1928. In 1928, the first Soviet-Japanese Fishing Convention was concluded. Japan leased 255 out of 511 salmon fishing plots and 14 out of 47 crab fishing plots. In addition, for both Soviet Russia and Japan, the signing of the fishing agreement essentially became the first step towards legally regulated relations between the countries, albeit within a single industry and a single region.\n\nIts term expired in 1932, but it was extended for another 4 years. Now its new term is expiring, and as a result, the Japanese government is proposing that we conclude a new convention that will take into account the changes in the nature of the fishing industry over the past years: new technologies and scales of extraction."
NW_JAP.704.a: "We are ready to conclude a new agreement."
NW_JAP.704.b: "We will not negotiate with the imperialists."
NW_JAP.705.t: "Signing of the New Fishing Convention"
NW_JAP.705.d: "The Soviet government has approved our proposal to conclude a new fishing agreement due to the expiration of the previous one and changes in the scale and nature of this industry in the Far East."
NW_JAP.705.a: "This is a step towards normalizing relations."
NW_JAP.706.t: "Refusal to Conclude a New Fishing Agreement"
NW_JAP.706.d: "The Soviet government has refused to conclude a new fishing convention with us concerning this activity in the Far Eastern waters belonging to the Soviet Union but little used by them. This may indicate their aggressive stance towards us and a desire to eliminate even our current fishing industry volumes."
NW_JAP.706.a: "We will look for options to preserve the treaty."
NW_JAP.707.t: "Extension of the Fishing Convention with Japan" 
NW_JAP.707.d: "Due to our refusal to conclude a new fishing agreement with the Japanese Empire, its government is proposing that we at least extend the previous convention for another year. Refusing even this offer and allowing the 1928 convention to expire will lead to a sharp deterioration in relations with Japan."
NW_JAP.707.a: "Let's extend the old convention."
NW_JAP.707.b: "We will not extend the convention."
NW_JAP.708.t: "The Soviets Have Extended the Convention"
NW_JAP.708.d: "The Soviet government has agreed to extend the 1928 fishing convention for another year. This suggests they do not want a complete breakdown of relations, and perhaps within the next year, we can achieve a full-fledged new convention."
NW_JAP.708.a: "All is not lost yet."
NW_JAP.709.t: "The Soviets Refused to Extend the Convention"
NW_JAP.709.d: "The Soviet government has refused to extend the 1928 fishing convention for another year, which confirms the suspicions of some of our diplomats about the aggressive intentions of the Soviet government in the Far East and their desire to end mutually beneficial cooperation in the fishing industry in this region." 
NW_JAP.709.a: "We must prepare for this."
NW_JAP.710.t: "Fishing Convention with Japan Terminated"
NW_JAP.710.d: "At the beginning of the century, Russo-Japanese contacts in the field of fisheries were a complex combination of contradictions and cooperation. Russian fishermen, protecting their interests, tried with the help of the Priamurye Governor-Generalship to limit the extremely developed fishing activities of Japanese fishermen off the coast of Primorye. At the same time, it was difficult for Russian fish industrialists to do without Japanese fishing techniques and gear, purchased in Japan, and without Japanese sales markets, which by the beginning of the 20th century were one of the main ones for Russian fish exports in the Far East.\n\nIn 1925, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between the USSR and Japan, negotiations on fisheries began, which were difficult and continued until 1928.

In addition, for both Soviet Russia and Japan, the signing of the fishing agreement essentially became the first step towards legally regulated relations between the countries, albeit within a single industry and a single region.\n\nIts term expired in 1932, but it was extended for another 4 years. Since then, negotiations for an additional extension of its term or the conclusion of a new agreement have not been successful, and today it has ceased to be in effect, which means that Japanese fishermen and fishing companies no longer have the right to be in our waters. In this regard, a deterioration of relations with the Japanese Empire should be expected, which may use this as a reason for armed provocations."
NW_JAP.710.a: "We will be ready for this."
NW_JAP.711.t: "Konoe Wants to Take a Different Post"
NW_JAP.711.d.a: "Today, Prime Minister Konoe is resigning, but at the same time, he wishes to take the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, which is currently held by Yuasa Kurahei. Genro Saionji has opposed this move, calling it 'illogical,' and seeks to prevent Konoe, who has strong support from the army, from gaining influence at the imperial court, as the role of the Lord Keeper, despite its name, involves controlling all of the emperor's contacts with the government and ministers."
NW_JAP.711.d.b: "Today, Prime Minister Konoe is resigning, but at the same time, he wishes to take the post of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, which is currently held by Yuasa Kurahei. Konoe has strong support from the army to gain influence at the imperial court, as the role of the Lord Keeper, despite its name, involves controlling all of the emperor's contacts with the government and ministers."
NW_JAP.711.a: "We approve of this proposal."
NW_JAP.711.b: "We do not approve of this idea."
NW_JAP.712.t: "Kido Replaces Konoe"
NW_JAP.712.d: "Due to Prince Konoe taking on a new position, his friend and fellow member of the 'young aristocrats,' Koichi Kido, with whom he studied at university, will replace him as Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. Kido proved himself during the February 26 Incident by maintaining communication between the emperor and genro Saionji, and has since held several ministerial posts."
NW_JAP.712.a: "They are forming a powerful alliance."
NW_JAP.713.t: "Conflict in the Diplomatic Corps in Berlin"
NW_JAP.713.d: "Our ambassador in Berlin is Shigenori Togo, an ethnic Korean whose father adopted a Japanese surname and gave his son a Japanese name. After receiving an education in German literature at Meiji University, he passed the diplomat exams and joined the diplomatic corps in Berlin immediately after the end of the Great War. During his service, Togo met and fell in love with a Jewish German newspaper reporter, Edde de Lalande. It is said that their relationship began under the influence of a collection of Goethe's romantic poems. After returning from Germany, he convinced his parents, who were against the marriage, and they married at the famous Imperial Hotel in Tokyo in 1922.\n\nAt that time, Germany was going through a period of turmoil, but Japanese-German relations were relatively stable. However, by now the Nazi party has consolidated its power, and the situation has changed dramatically. Their aggressive foreign policy, but primarily their domestic policy, such as the persecution of Jews, is becoming more and more obvious. Initially devoted to German literature and with a deep understanding of German culture, Togo cannot help but feel hatred for the Nazis.\n\nAt the same time, the post of military attache is held by General Hiroshi Oshima, a great admirer of Nazism—many think more of Nazism than of Germany, although he knows German perfectly, which has allowed him to establish close contact with the Nazi foreign policy leader Joachim von Ribbentrop since his appointment to this post in 1934. Thanks to this, he has already met with the Fuhrer himself several times. His idea is to conclude a military alliance between Japan and Germany, which is supported by many mid-ranking officers of the Imperial Army. Because of this, a strong antagonistic relationship has been established between our ambassador and attache, and Oshima is even trying to 'squeeze' Togo out of his position through his connections in the army leadership with the aim of becoming the ambassador in Berlin himself. We must resolve this conflict so that it does not lead to a loss of Japan's reputation in the eyes of the Germans."
NW_JAP.713.a: "Let Oshima take the post he desires."
NW_JAP.713.b: "Oshima must do his job and not interfere in diplomacy."
NW_JAP.714.t: "Change of Ambassador in Moscow"
NW_JAP.714.d: "The recall of Shigenori Togo from Berlin allows this experienced diplomat to be used for other important diplomatic work. Currently, our embassy in Moscow is facing difficulties, where Mamoru Shigemitsu, the diplomat who concluded the agreement to end the 1932 Shanghai Incident, holds his position. During its signing, a Korean terrorist carried out an attack, as a result of which Mamoru lost a leg, but despite this, he completed all his diplomatic duties. Over the past two years, he has not managed to establish good contact with Soviet diplomats, and on the contrary, there is a feeling that the Soviet government is biased against Mamoru. We value his abilities, but perhaps we should carry out a reshuffle of ambassadors, sending Togo to Moscow and Mamoru to the United Kingdom, where his experience will bring more success."
NW_JAP.714.a: "We shall do so."
NW_JAP.714.b: "Mamoru will remain in his position, and Togo will go to London."
NW_JAP.715.t: "Negotiations with the Japanese Ambassador"
NW_JAP.715.d: "The new Japanese ambassador in Moscow is proposing to our government to conclude an agreement with Japan to improve relations between the countries. According to the Japanese ambassador's idea, each side will make mutual concessions: Japan will renounce its claims to the northern part of Sakhalin Island and liquidate its concessions there, and the USSR will cease supplying aid to the Chinese government. A neutrality pact will also be signed between our states."
NW_JAP.715.a: "We are ready to accept these terms."
NW_JAP.715.b: "We are ready only on the condition of the return of Southern Sakhalin."
NW_JAP.716.t: "Unsuccessful Negotiations with Moscow"
NW_JAP.716.d: "The negotiations our ambassador conducted in Moscow with Soviet diplomatic representatives have failed. The Soviets demanded too high a price for such an agreement, only at the cost of ceding Southern Sakhalin, which is an absurd proposal not based in reality."
NW_JAP.716.a: "We understand their position."
NW_JAP.717.t: "The Fate of the Jews"
NW_JAP.717.d.a: "Since the end of the Great War, the theme of Zionism and support for the Jews has been supported by some Japanese intellectuals and politicians. In the 1920s, 'Jewish experts' emerged in the army and navy: Army Colonel Yasue Norihiro and Navy Captain Koreshige Inuzuka, who began to study the Jewish way of life and conditions around the world. After the proclamation of Manchukuo, they established contact with the Manchurian faction in the army, and Yasue directly became a member of it, and thanks to this, they began to promote their idea in the government. It consists of inviting from 50,000 to 600,000 or even a million Jews from Europe to resettle in Manchuria, near Harbin, where the necessary infrastructure will be created for them, and full religious and cultural freedom will be provided in accordance with the principles of racial equality we promote. These Jews will bring their capital with them, or at least help to form a positive image of Japan in the United States of America, where the Jewish lobby is known to be strong."
NW_JAP.717.d.b: "$NW_JAP.717.d.a$\n\nHowever, this plan faces problems due to a possible alliance between Germany and our country, where some politicians express their dissatisfaction with our promoted idea of racial equality with the Jews."
NW_JAP.717.a: "We will adopt the plan in its entirety."
NW_JAP.717.b: "We will be ready to accept them and treat them on an equal level with other peoples."
NW_JAP.717.c: "We will ban Jewish immigration."
NW_JAP.718.t: "Choosing the Location for Autonomy"
NW_JAP.718.d: "Since our army has captured the city of Shanghai and its surroundings, we have a choice between which region to grant autonomy to the Jewish population. It was initially assumed that Manchukuo, which supports the principles of racial harmony, would become the new home for the Jews, but the Jews there only ended up after the civil war in Russia, having fled there with other Russian emigrants. However, an even larger number of them have long lived in Shanghai, which is also a more Europeanized city with a large number of foreigners who will thus be able to better study and see with their own eyes the creation of comfortable living conditions for the Jews, improving Japan's image and attracting even more settlers. On the other hand, this will cause even more problems and conflicts with the local Chinese population and undermine the legitimacy of local governments."
NW_JAP.718.a: "The Jews should settle in Manchukuo."
NW_JAP.718.b: "The Jews should settle in Shanghai and its surroundings."
NW_JAP.719.t: "Guiding Principles Regarding the Jews"
NW_JAP.719.d: "A special government conference dedicated specifically to the issue of dealing with the Jews has finally issued its affirmative verdict on the long-standing plan of the Jewish experts from the Manchurian faction of the military on the need to attract the Jewish population fleeing persecution in Europe under the wing of the Japanese Empire, specifically to Manchukuo, where they will be provided with all the conditions for creating their cultural and religious autonomy within the framework of our state's racial harmony. Now our government is faced with the question of where the Jewish settlers will create their new national home—two options are being considered: either the Jews will be able to settle freely throughout the territory of Manchukuo, or they will be given one province for settlement. In the latter case, such a province will be the former Rehe region on the border with China, which will allow for additional demarcation between our states."
NW_JAP.719.a: "The Jews can settle freely."
NW_JAP.719.b: "The Jews should be allocated a region in the former Rehe province."
NW_JAP.720.t: "The Reform Bureaucrats Have Crossed the Line"
NW_JAP.720.d: "The reform bureaucrats have gone too far with their reforms—with their ambitious plans, they have frightened almost all layers of the old elites: the owners of the zaibatsu, conservative and traditional politicians, some military personnel, and even the Imperial Court. All this led to the Prime Minister having to resign, making way for someone else with less radical views on restructuring the country. According to the recommendation of the senior vassals, it could be Prince Fumimaro Konoe, who has long been preparing to take this post, or Kiichiro Hiranuma, a long-time opponent of all left-wing reformers."
NW_JAP.720.a: "Technocracy was not realized this time; Konoe will take over." 
NW_JAP.720.b: "Technocracy was not realized this time; Hiranuma will restore stability."
NW_JAP.721.t: "Spy Ring Uncovered in Tokyo"
NW_JAP.721.d: "The Special Higher Police have been investigating a communist spy network in Tokyo for over a year. The other day, they finally found a lead through a random clue and arrested one of the participants, a Japanese man of Okinawan origin who had been living on the Pacific coast of the USA for a long time, where a large number of communist spies are known to operate. After a search and interrogation at his home, he gave up the other members of the group: Branko de Vukelic, the Far East correspondent for the Parisian news agency Havas; Max Clausen, a German trade representative; Richard Sorge, a PhD from Hamburg University, a representative of the Frankfurter Zeitung and the senior German correspondent in Tokyo, a regular contributor to the most influential strategic journal in Germany, Zeitschrift fur Geopolitik, and, most importantly, the personal political advisor and confidant of the German ambassador in Tokyo, General Eugen Ott. But the heaviest blow was that the fifth participant was Hotsumi Ozaki—one of Prince Konoe's closest advisors, also a journalist and, as was believed, an expert on Asian politics. When Konoe learned of Ozaki's true identity, he was shocked and apologized to the Emperor, saying: 'I deeply regret and feel a deep responsibility for what was completely unknown to me.'"
NW_JAP.721.a: "Konoe must resign to take responsibility for the incident." 
NW_JAP.721.b: "Konoe knew who he was dealing with and will surely regret it."
NW_JAP.722.t: "Purge in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry"
NW_JAP.722.d: "For the last 6 years, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has been under the control of the so-called Yoshino-Kishi line—two bureaucrats: the mentor Shinji Yoshino and his closest assistant Nobusuke Kishi. Yoshino was one of the first bureaucrats in the ministry to lobby for the ideas of targeted industrial development back in the 1920s, which was facilitated by his experience studying abroad during the Great War. Kishi, although his 'successor,' is an even more radical figure—he is one of the most prominent representatives of the so-called 'reform bureaucrats,' a group of young professionals who want to establish a controlled economy in particular and increase government power in general, looking at similar examples in Germany and the Soviet Union. Such ideas cannot but cause discontent among representatives of business and the financial world.\n\nIn the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the military mutiny alarmed many otherwise complacent bureaucrats; Yoshino admits in private conversations that as a result of this incident, he lost control of the ministry. The military began to have even more influence on appointments in the cabinet, but within the ministries, passive resistance to the militarists and their friends was developing. Business leaders also began to cautiously oppose the Yoshino-Kishi line, but they cannot speak out openly for fear of new assassination attempts. However, to secure the cooperation of industry, the military had to compromise on whom they were willing to see as Minister of Commerce and Industry, which meant tolerating ministers who were graduates of Kyoto University or were acceptable to business. One such compromise candidate was Ogawa Gotaro, a former professor of economics at Kyoto University and a member of the House of Representatives from the Rikken Minseito, elected since 1917.\n\nTo get rid of Yoshino and Kishi, Ogawa chose a conciliatory tactic: he offered Yoshino to head the newly created Tohoku Industrial Development Company, a Japanese version of the Tennessee Valley Authority for the development of a backward region. And he told Kishi that the Kwantung Army had urgently requested his work in the government of Manchukuo (which was true). Yoshino considered refusing to resign on the grounds that as an imperial official he could not be dismissed, but changed his mind. He realized that he had been in the post of vice-minister for too long and knew that junior officials in the ministry were holding meetings on the political situation to which he was not invited. One day, Yoshino and Kishi jointly submitted their resignations. Yoshino went to Tohoku, where he was born, and Kishi became the deputy director of the Industrial Department of the Manchukuo government."

NW_JAP_news.81.d: "General Kanji Ishiwara, the man who once held the post of head of martial law in Tokyo during the mutiny of young officers on February 26, returns to this role today. A hero of Manchuria, who organized its capture, a popular figure among the people, it was he who turned out to be the figure capable of becoming a military dictator in today's Japan. Ishiwara, with the support of his followers, formed his own new government and introduced martial law throughout the country. The parliament's assembly has been suspended, and additional censorship restrictions have been imposed on the media."
NW_JAP_news.81 .a: "It's ironic that the man who suppressed one military coup led his own."
NW_JAP_news.82.t: "[GetNews Headline] Assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister"
NW_JAP_news.82.d: "Surprising news has come from the warring Japanese Empire—the state's prime minister, General Tojo, was killed while riding in his car in Tokyo. According to fragmented information, this incident was carried out by a group of conspirators associated either with the navy, which has long been in conflict with army leaders, or with a group of officers in the army dissatisfied with Tojo's rule. The murdered prime minister was known for his dictatorial style of rule—he even earned the nickname 'Tojo shogunate' in society, making many enemies. [JAP.GetLeader] has been appointed the new head of the Japanese government."
NW_JAP_news.82.a: "Is the Japanese army not as monolithic as it seems?"
NW_JAP_news.83.t: "[GetNews Headline] Coup d'etat in the Japanese Empire" 
NW_JAP_news.83.d: "A coup d'etat has taken place in Tokyo—the emperor's uncle, Prince Naruhiko, with the support of the Imperial Court, a group of senior vassals, as well as loyal army units and the navy, has isolated Emperor Hirohito, declared him incapable of performing his duties, and the throne has passed to his son, under whom a regency will be established in his person. In this post, he immediately issued a decree dissolving the previous government and forming a new one, in which he will simultaneously hold the post of prime minister. The whereabouts of the former prime minister, General Tojo, are currently unknown, but there is information that he has also been arrested."
NW_JAP_news.83.a: "Unexpected."
NW_JAP_news.84.t: "[GetNews Headline] USSR and Japan Conclude Non-Aggression Pact"
NW_JAP_news.84.d: "The Soviet Union and the Japanese Empire have unexpectedly concluded a non-aggression pact, to the surprise of the whole world. These two countries have perceived each other as hostile since the very appearance of the USSR on the world map, but now their relations have warmed to such an agreement. Perhaps this was a consequence of the first left-wing government in Japan's history—the parliamentary socialist party formed the current cabinet of ministers."
NW_JAP_news.84.a: "Parliamentarism would obviously have led to this sooner or later."
NW_JAP_news.85.t: "[GetNews Headline] The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money"
NW_JAP_news.85.d: "Today in London, a new work by the famous economist John Maynard Keynes was published. Its volume is over 450 pages, and work on it was carried out for more than 5 years with the support of his 'Cambridge Circus.' The central argument of 'The General Theory' is that the level of employment is determined not by the price of labor, as in classical economics, but by the level of aggregate demand. If the total demand for goods at full employment is less than the total volume of production, the economy is forced to contract until equality is achieved. Thus, Keynes denied that full employment is the natural result of the equilibrium state of competitive markets. Keynes did not set out a detailed policy program in 'The General Theory,' but in practice, he paid great attention to reducing long-term interest rates and reforming the international monetary system."
NW_JAP_news.85.a: "This is an important book after so many years of struggling with the consequences of the Great Depression."
NW_JAP_news.86.t: "[GetNews Headline] Japan and the USSR Sign a Neutrality Pact"
NW_JAP_news.86.d: "The governments of the Japanese Empire and the Soviet Union held negotiations in Moscow through the Japanese ambassador and concluded a treaty that includes a neutrality pact and a number of mutual concessions: Japan renounces its claims to Northern Sakhalin and liquidates its concessions there, and the Soviet Union promises not to interfere in the ongoing Sino-Japanese conflict, which apparently implies a reduction or complete cessation of Soviet aid supplies to the Chinese government."
NW_JAP_news.86.a: "This is a stab in the back."
NW_JAP_news.86.b: "Does this mean we should not expect a war between them?" 
NW_JAP_news.86.c: "A good deal."
NW_JAP_news.87.t: "[GetNews Headline] The Fall of the Konoe Cabinet" 
NW_JAP_news.87.d: "A change of government has occurred in the Japanese Empire. Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe has unexpectedly resigned. Some diplomatic workers in Tokyo link this event with a series of recent arrests of foreign journalists from several international publications in the Japanese capital, suspected of espionage for the Soviet Union. It is believed that Konoe thus took responsibility for the scandal, as some of those arrested were among his advisors. The new government of Japan is headed by [JAP.GetLeader]."
NW_JAP_news.87.a: "Have the communists really penetrated so deeply, and this wasn't just spy mania?"

 JAP_Naisen_Ittai: "Naisen Ittai"
 JAP_Naisen_Ittai_desc: "Korea had a great chance of becoming an independent state in Asia on a par with China and Japan - the Russian Empire stood up for it, seeking to weaken its neighbors in this way. However, the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War led to the expulsion of the Russians from the Korean peninsula and despite the continued assistance from the "White Tsar" (support of Korean diplomats at the international level, financing and arming of Korean guerrillas), 5 years later Korea was under the direct rule of the Japanese Empire in 1910, when the last (already puppet) Emperor of Korea Sunjong transferred all his sovereign power to the Japanese Emperor..\n\nIn 25 years, a whole generation of people who had never lived outside the Japanese Empire had grown up - and they had virtually lost interest in the idea of national independence, given how brutally any anti-Japanese demonstrations were suppressed. Koreans have become willing to put up with it if they can have some cultural autonomy: the ability to learn the Korean language, publish newspapers in it, and create art.\n\nThis long road will gradually lead to the full integration of Koreans and basically make them full citizens of the Empire, but it is resisted by members of the army, who are most often appointed as governors general of Korea. Leaving the Koreans in limbo will allow them to be used as cheap labor or perhaps even cannon fodder in future wars."

Therefore, the number of agrarian settlers amounted to a measly few hundred people.\n\nAfter the onset of the Great Depression, the condition of the country's peasant population deteriorated further, and many members of the Nohonshugi movement began to urge the government to pay attention to the plight of impoverished peasants. After the creation of Manchukuo, one way of solving this problem was to possibly help Japanese farmers resettle in Manchuria. In this way, we will also eliminate the problem of land shortage due to the growing population of the archipelago."

 JAP_turanist_union_category_desc: "In the 1920s and 1930s, Turanism gained some support in Japan, mainly among the military elite and intellectuals. Japanese Turanists argued that the Japanese were of inland Asian origin and that the ancestors of the Japanese had migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikazo argued that the Japanese were descended from the Tungus branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose roots were in northeast China, in Manchuria. And since the Japanese, Koreans and Manchus were descended from the Tungus, they also had links with other Turanian sub-ethnic groups such as the Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugri in terms of blood, language and culture. Over 20 years, several organizations had been established to strengthen cooperation with the Turanist countries and to print relevant literature. They insist that the Japanese leave the tragically small Japanese islands and move to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent where their ancestors once lived. To do this, they will have to reclaim these ancestral lands from the Slavs by making an alliance with the Turanian peoples."

Moreover, since the founders of the Society were rather highly ideologised ultra-nationalists and to some extent independent from the authorities, sometimes their policy was quite realistically at odds with the line of the state, sometimes leading to acts of struggle between the government and the Society. Thus, for example, since the beginning of the century they have supported various anti-colonial movements in Asia - in India, the Philippines and China. It is no secret that both Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kaishi are friends of the founders of the Amur River Society. One of Kōdōha's goals was to bring the Amur River Society to manage the country's foreign policy as the persons who are most interested in and consistently advocate the ideas of pan-Asianism in the world."

In 1928, the first Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Convention was concluded. Japan has leased 255 out of 511 salmon fishing sites and 14 out of 47 crab fishing sites. In addition, for both Soviet Russia and Japan, the signing of the fishing agreement was essentially the first step towards legally regulated relations between the countries, even within the same industry and the same region.\n\nHer term expired in 1932, but she was extended for another 4 years. Now its new term is also expiring, and the task has arisen either to conclude a new convention or to extend the old one. The first option is preferable, since the nature and scale of fishing has changed significantly over the past 10 years, new technologies have appeared, and all this needs to be clarified in the new agreement."

 NW_JAP_aht.1.t: "Rally for the Establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.1.d: "Before the inauguration of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, a celebratory rally was held, during which leaders of the main political groups within it spoke. One of them was Seigō Nakano, who declared that a movement like the New Political Structure was possible only because, thanks to Japan's unique national polity, even opposing groups could unite."
 NW_JAP_aht.1.a: "A fine point."

 NW_JAP_aht.2.t: "Transformation of the Tōhōkai"
 NW_JAP_aht.2.d: "Seigō Nakano was appointed one of the eleven executive directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Before this, he dissolved his Tōhōkai party, but not completely - he transformed it into a cultural organization named Shintōsha, after the former Kaneko academy in Dairen. Among its branches is an academy called Shintjuku, dedicated to martial arts and the study of philosophy and history, where Nakano himself sometimes lectures."
 NW_JAP_aht.2.a: "Dissolved the party, but not quite."

 NW_JAP_aht.3.t: "Nakano's Speeches"
 NW_JAP_aht.3.d: "Seigō Nakano divides most of his time between meetings of the Board of Directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, during which he must advise the government on policy and public sentiment, and giving speeches that are supposed to increase public involvement in the Association's activities. Naturally, however, they tend to increase the specific weight of his own faction within it."
 NW_JAP_aht.3.a: "A cunning plan."

 NW_JAP_aht.4.t: "Reorganization of Hashimoto's Party"
 NW_JAP_aht.4.d: "Kingorō Hashimoto, who has also reorganized his Great Japan Youth Party into the Sekiseikai (Society of Sincerity), is no less active in this period than his colleagues from the 'renovationist' camp, such as Seigō Nakano. For many outsiders, this raises questions about the sincerity of Hashimoto's intentions, but they do not know that this was a condition for Hashimoto's participation in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association project and the dissolution of his party."
 NW_JAP_aht.4.a: "He schemes and plays his own game."

 NW_JAP_aht.5.t: "Accusations from Bin Akao"
 NW_JAP_aht.5.d: "The right-wing traditionalists are extremely dissatisfied with the influence of right-wing radicals in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association due to their much larger number of members. Bin Akao, now one of the leading figures in the Japanist wing, has accused his rivals of insincerity for not completely dissolving their own organizations. This is primarily addressed to Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto."
 NW_JAP_aht.5.a: "They have provoked a public reaction."

 NW_JAP_aht.6.t: "Attack on Nakano's Supporter"
 NW_JAP_aht.6.d: "Today, a surprise attack on supporters of Seigō Nakano occurred – during his visit to Hiroshima, a young supporter from his society's youth corps was wounded with a knife. It is believed that right-wing traditionalists may be responsible. It is also of some interest that Nakano's former 'bodyguard,' Terada Inejirō, has now switched to his opponents' camp, and his former functions have since been taken over by Sato Morio, a former soldier from the fighting in China."
 NW_JAP_aht.6.a: "It seems strife and disputes have only intensified with the Association's creation."

 NW_JAP_aht.7.t: "The New Economic Structure Project"
 NW_JAP_aht.7.d: "The Kikakuin, or Cabinet Planning Board, has developed a plan for a New Economic Structure, which represents an extreme form of state control, proposing to 'liberate management from the capitalist constraints applied in the pursuit of profit.'\nThis was to be achieved by limiting dividends and public control over the appointments of top management in key industries or control bodies, which would be coordinated by the Planning Bureau of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association.\nSmall enterprises would be ruthlessly rationalized."
 NW_JAP_aht.7.a: "It should be kept secret for now."
 NW_JAP_aht.7.b: "We should begin the process of its discussion."

 NW_JAP_aht.8.t: "Criticism of the New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP_aht.8.d: "When the plan's contents became known, it was fiercely criticized by both business and right-wing traditionalists. A leading group, including the éminence grise Toyama and General Araki, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister demanding the dismissal of socialists from the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Some members of the same group issued a 'Manifesto in Defense of the Constitution,' pointing out that the Constitution protects private property and accusing the 'renovationists' of aiding the enemy by sowing discord."
 NW_JAP_aht.8.a: "This was to be expected."

 NW_JAP_aht.9.t: "Discussion in the Cabinet"
 NW_JAP_aht.9.d: "During cabinet discussions, the New Economic Structure plan was criticized and amended by former party ministers and finance ministers, which, however, met with some resistance from the armed forces. The revised version of the plan was sent back to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association for consideration."
 NW_JAP_aht.9.a: "Very well."

 NW_JAP_aht.10.t: "Board of Directors Meeting"
 NW_JAP_aht.10.d: "The Board of Directors of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association discussed the draft of the New Economic Structure received after the cabinet's revisions, but did not fully agree with them and leaned towards adopting its original version, developed by the Cabinet Planning Board."
 NW_JAP_aht.10.a: "They will stand by this plan to the end."

 NW_JAP_aht.11.t: "Nakano's Alternative"
 NW_JAP_aht.11.d: "Seigō Nakano, with connections to both business and the military, has attempted to devise an alternative to the original New Economic Structure project that could better serve the interests of both sides. At the Board of Directors, he presented a nine-point statement on the 'basic principles of economic reform,' criticizing the Cabinet Planning Board for 'superficial theorizing' and 'left-wing totalitarianism disguised as Imperial Way totalitarianism,' which 'disregards the practical activities of private organizations, but in the name of uniformity of private life, property, and state administration, calls for their consolidation into companies engaged in national policy.'\nIn contrast, he proposed that 'private organizations play an independent role in carrying out national policy,' allowing for some competition between them in the interests of increasing efficiency."
 NW_JAP_aht.11.d.add: "\n\nHe viewed France under the Popular Front of socialism as a catastrophic example, while Nazi Germany had found the right formula."
 NW_JAP_aht.11.a: "We will consider it."

 NW_JAP_aht.12.t: "Compromise Bill"
 NW_JAP_aht.12.d: "The creation of a worthy compromise version of the New Economic Structure project has occupied the main attention of the members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. It proposes a bill on industrial organizations that would provide for economic control through autonomous associations in accordance with its general plan. They would select executives to cooperate with the Kikakuin in planning and with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in implementing projects, which would be carried out according to government instructions sent to the associations.\n\nOther features included that excess profits would be converted into bonds; small enterprises would be rationalized only in case of difficulties; wages would be proportional to efficiency, and management would not be appointed by the state, except for industrial associations, and then on the basis of nominations by members."
 NW_JAP_aht.12.a: "This is a good solution."

 NW_JAP_aht.13.t: "Difficulties with the Compromise"
 NW_JAP_aht.13.d: "Although the compromise bill was planned for discussion in parliament, the government faced such difficulties that it was decided instead to develop another version of the New Economic Structure - a system of planning by decree under the General Mobilization Law.\n\nSeigō Nakano described the compromise bill as suppressed by 'hypocritical bureaucrats and members of parliament serving liberal capitalists.' Due to the resulting direct confrontation between the government and big business, the political intervention Nakano had hoped for was ruled out, so he had little to offer the business community for their support, which, incidentally, has since waned."
 NW_JAP_aht.13.a: "This is the very last possible option for implementing economic reform."

 NW_JAP_aht.14.t: "Problems in Parliament"
 NW_JAP_aht.14.d: "The government has begun to face serious problems in parliament, related to attacks on the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as an unconstitutional body. One argument was that parliament was losing its independence in legislation and in conducting audits if all its members were part of a body headed by the prime minister. The absence of many 'renovationist' representatives in parliament severely hampered their ability to defend the Association from attacks in the lower house. Members of parliament decided to cut the budget of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, while the zaibatsu cooperated with them by withholding interim funds on the basis of the alleged influence of 'reds' in the Association."
 NW_JAP_aht.14.a: "This is the beginning of the end for the Association project..."

 NW_JAP_aht.15.t: "Hiranuma's Statement"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.d.Hiranuma: "After criticism of the government began in parliament, Akira Kazami was replaced as Minister of Justice by General Yanagawa of the 'Imperial Way' faction. Almost immediately after this reshuffle, Hiranuma stated in parliament that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has no political status, being merely a public organization, and promised to reorganize it accordingly. After this, the reduced budget was passed, which, however, led to the swift resignation of Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto from their posts. Nakano told reporters that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, despite its limited budget, 'was destroyed by obsolete forces, professional right-wingers, financial capitalists, and representatives of the fifth column.'"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.d: "After criticism of the government began in parliament, to control the situation, [JAP.GetLeader] brought Hiranuma into the cabinet as Minister of Home Affairs, while Akira Kazami was replaced as Minister of Justice by General Yanagawa of the 'Imperial Way' faction. Almost immediately after this reshuffle, Hiranuma stated in parliament that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has no political status, being merely a public organization, and promised to reorganize it accordingly. After this, the reduced budget was passed, which, however, led to the swift resignation of Seigō Nakano and Kingorō Hashimoto from their posts. Nakano told reporters that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, despite its limited budget, 'was destroyed by obsolete forces, professional right-wingers, financial capitalists, and representatives of the fifth column.'"
 NW_JAP_aht.15.a: "A harsh decision."

 NW_JAP_aht.16.t: "The Military's Attempt to Save the Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.16.d: "The military from the Tōseiha faction were dissatisfied with this turn of events, such as the rejection of economic reform projects. General Akira Mutō tried to preserve a political role for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, but he failed. Hiranuma managed to lead a movement too powerful to overcome, aimed at eliminating all the reformist aspirations of the Association."
 NW_JAP_aht.16.a: "Does this prove that the civilian government is capable of subordinating the military?"

 NW_JAP_aht.17.t: "The Red Affair"
 NW_JAP_aht.17.d: "Today, the Kempeitai raided the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, resulting in the arrest of almost all the original authors of the new economic structure project. The secret police justify this operation on suspicion that these bureaucrats 'sympathize with socialist and communist ideas' and 'want to undermine the state system,' for which the incident has been dubbed the 'Red Affair' in the media. This is a severe blow to the reputation of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and personally to Prince Konoe's circle. It is said that the Kempeitai operation was initiated at the behest of opponents of the plan's implementation, which gives hope that the arrested will be released quickly."
 NW_JAP_aht.17.a: "It seems the repressive machine is out of control."

 NW_JAP_aht.18.t: "Repressive Amendments to Laws"
 NW_JAP_aht.18.d: "On the initiative of the Privy Council, the House of Representatives has passed additional repressive amendments to the existing laws on the protection of the state system. This is a clear signal to those who wanted to use the Imperial Rule Assistance Association to reshape the system of state power for themselves. And it seems that this is the final stroke in its helplessness. It is believed that the main driver of these amendments was the chief opponent of the economic reform project – Kiichirō Hiranuma."
 NW_JAP_aht.18.a: "The traditional forces have won."

 NW_JAP_aht.19.t: "Reforming the Association"
 NW_JAP_aht.19.d: "The leadership of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, headed by Arima Yoriyasu, has resigned due to the circumstances of its functioning, or rather, dysfunction. After this, Kiichirō Hiranuma was finally able to reform the Association in accordance with his plans, according to which it will be a 'public' rather than a 'political' organization: the political, planning, and parliamentary bureaus of the Association were abolished, and its prefectural branches were subordinated to the governors, that is, to the Ministry of Home Affairs."
 NW_JAP_aht.19.a: "The Association has finally become an auxiliary body of the bureaucracy."

 NW_JAP_aht.20.t: "Resignation of the Radicals"
 NW_JAP_aht.20.d: "Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] has dismissed the last supporters of a radical vision for the Imperial Rule Assistance Association from among the reformist bureaucrats: Naoki Hoshino and Kishi Nobusuke. Their place was taken by the influential industrialist Ogura Masatsune. However, to maintain bureaucratic balance, the main economic opponent of the project, Kobayashi Ichizō, also resigned. Now the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has finally turned into a facade and a shadow of its planned greatness – Japan continues to exist as if it never was."
 NW_JAP_aht.20.a: "The bigger they are, the harder they fall."

 NW_JAP_aht.21.t: "Failure of the New Economic Structure"
 NW_JAP_aht.21.d: "One of the main goals pursued by the military from the Tōseiha faction and some of the 'renovationists,' especially from Prince Konoe's circle, in creating the Imperial Rule Assistance Association was to carry out economic reform, involving the establishment or at least partial introduction of planned elements into the Japanese economy. It is now quite clear that they will not be able to achieve it. All repeated attempts at such proposals are defeated each time due to the overly strong influence of the zaibatsu, as well as traditionalist politicians and Japanists from parliament."
 NW_JAP_aht.21.a: "Time will tell if this idea has been buried for good or merely postponed again."

 NW_JAP_aht.22.t: "Long Disputes over the Association's Status"
 NW_JAP_aht.22.d: "During six meetings of the preparatory committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, sharp disagreements arose over the status of the proposed organization, as the head of the Bureau of Military Affairs (the army's main agent of influence on policy) openly called for the creation of a single national party structure. However, it was decided that the proposed body would not be a political association, as this would imply the exclusion of some part of the nation, but merely a body 'supplementing the government.' Thus, the prime minister would be its chairman by virtue of his office."
 NW_JAP_aht.22.a: "The Association is struggling to gain ground."

 NW_JAP_aht.23.t: "A Difficult Decision on the Status of Governors"
 NW_JAP_aht.23.d: "Another hotly debated issue at the meetings of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association concerned whether the heads of the Association's branches should be prefectural governors, which is crucial to the nature of this body as either administrative or political. Adopting such an option would imply a duplication of the state and 'party' hierarchy, and thus a centralization of power, as governors would now become even less dependent in their actions. Also, and perhaps more importantly, the Ministry of Home Affairs would lose its position in the state. However, in the end, the supporters of such a radical project failed to push their idea through, and it was decided not to interfere with the existing power structure at the local level."
 NW_JAP_aht.23.a: "The purpose of the Association is fading before our eyes."

 NW_JAP_aht.24.t: "Nakano's Statement"
 NW_JAP_aht.24.d: "Today, Seigō Nakano published a statement in the newspapers, in which he declared that since all channels of political activity in the proper sense of the word have ceased to function, society is plunging into a vortex of intrigue, and that the Tōhōkai party will be revived to deal with this situation.\n\nThere are no legal obstacles to this, as the former parties disbanded in the struggle for participation in the new power structure, and not by coercion. Furthermore, since the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has now been declared non-political, another political party cannot be considered as competing with it."
 NW_JAP_aht.24.a: "A brilliant move. Is everything returning to how it was?"

 NW_JAP_aht.25.t: "The New Tōhōkai Platform"
 NW_JAP_aht.25.d: "Today, Seigō Nakano was officially declared president of the Tōhōkai party, whose new platform reads as follows:\n1. Declaring to those above the loyalty of the masses, we, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, will play a leading role in manifesting the imperial approach in politics.\n2. The pure spirit of Japan will be strengthened, strengthening Great East Asia and proclaiming justice throughout the world.\n3. An economic order of service to the whole people will be established, requiring labor and self-sacrifice from the entire nation, but promising honor and a livelihood.\n\nThe adopted rhetoric is clearly aimed at smoothing over some recent animosity, but since Nakano's political leverage has weakened as a result of the latest upheavals, he has taken a more reckless stance than ever, betting on the effectiveness of playing on two main sources of tension - the difficulties faced by small businesses under increased economic control and the hysteria caused by the rampant drive for war."
 NW_JAP_aht.25.a: "Nakano truly intends to revive parliamentary politics."

 NW_JAP_aht.26.t: "Hatoyama Revives the Liberal Party"
 NW_JAP_aht.26.d: "Ichirō Hatoyama, long dissatisfied with the changes taking place in the country, has planned to form a group of like-minded members to revive parliamentary politics. First, a 'Census Association' was formed, and today, with Hatoyama as the group's representative, 37 members of parliament have formed the Dōkōkai party. It has been joined by former representatives of different parties, both Seiyūkai and Minseitō, and even some deputies from the Shakai Taishūtō. Hatoyama's actions have received particularly important support from the 'father of constitutional politics,' Yukio Ozaki – the oldest member of parliament, who has been a deputy since 1891 and is the country's most steadfast and radical liberal politician. In the early 30s, he left all parties and became an independent deputy, as he was disillusioned with the parties of that time and their cooperation with the military. Now, it seems, he is ready to support the new movement."
 NW_JAP_aht.26.a: "This is now becoming alarming."
