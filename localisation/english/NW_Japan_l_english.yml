In the end, he concluded, "There is no one but Konoe." Prince Konoe declined the offer of the premiership, but his nomination marked a recognition by Saionji and others that court nobles such as Konoe, Kido, and Harada, who transcended party affiliation, represented the best prospect for easing tensions within and between elite groups. Disappointed in his first choice, Saionji recommended career diplomat Hirota Koki."

 JAP_Seva: "Shōwa"
 JAP_Seva_desc: "According to tradition, each emperor proclaims his own era upon ascension to the throne, to which he himself chooses a name. Hirohito, during his enthronement ceremony on 25 December 1926, gave it the name Shōwa. This term can be roughly understood as "enlightened world" or, in some interpretations, "shining Japan". In his address to the nation, the Emperor described why he chose this name: "I have visited the battlefields of the Great War in France. In the presence of such devastation, I realised the blessing of peace and the need for harmony among nations." However, in the political and military environment, many associate the name of the new era with the radical changes that are to take place in Japan, comparable to the Meiji Revolution, which clearly contradicts the emperor's words..."
 JAP_Reiva: "Reiwa"
 JAP_Heysei: "Heisei"
 JAP_army_factionalism: "Army Factionalism"
 JAP_army_factionalism_desc: "The new era brought new trends to the military environment - officers of various stripes became more and more interested in politics, more and more competitive with each other and, most importantly, with the civilian government. When economical stagnation began, it radicalised their actions, leading to a series of coup attempts to implement their own reforms, but on the other hand, it divided the military and forced them to fight with each other, which also resulted in a series of terrorist attacks and examples of extremism among them."
 JAP_zaibatsus: "Zaibatsu"
 JAP_zaibatsus_desc: "Large family-owned financial and industrial conglomerates, history of many of which began in the 17th century. Although they helped Japan undergo modernisation during the Meiji Restoration, these days their existence is frowned upon by many common people and elites due to the economic turmoil of recent years. They are being replaced by the "new Zaibatsu," which are already much more aimed to modern trends, but the "old" ones still continue to play an important role economically and sometimes politically."

 JAP_limited_zaibatsus: "Limited Zaibatsu"
 JAP_gekokujo: "Gekokujō"
 JAP_gekokujo_desc: "A Japanese word for someone in a lower position overthrowing someone in a higher position, using military or political might, seizing power. It is variously translated as "the lower rules the higher" or "the low overcomes the high." In recent years, militaries at all levels have become active in the practice of gekokujō, such as assassination attempts on politicians or foreigners, attempted coups d'etat, and sometimes even in the unauthorised seizure of Manchurian territory in China. Failure to put an end to this military freedom could have irreparable damage to the country.§!\n\n§9An excessive level of insubordination in the military would lead to their attempts to act independently in China and Asia, and will also allow them to influence the civilian government in Tokyo by intimidation and exploiting legal loopholes in the Meiji Constitution.§!\n\n\n§R To remove $JAP_gekokujo$, it is necessary to reduce the Insubordination Level to zero.§!"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society: "Kokuryūkai"
 JAP_Amur_River_Society_desc: "The secret organisation Kokuryūkai traces its history back to 1901, when it was founded by Japanese nationalist Ryōhei Uchida, originally to resist Russian influence in Asia. The name reflected its meaning - to drive the Russians beyond the Amur River, which in Chinese is called the Black Dragon River. After the organisation's spectacular successes during the Russo-Japanese War, high-ranking government officials, cabinet ministers and members of the state security agencies began to join the organisation. The organisation published a number of newspapers and magazines to promote its views. Kokuryūkai periodicals were published and distributed in China and Korea, and in English as well. "Amur Bulletin" received support, including financial support, from a number of Japanese corporations and large firms, as well as banks and trading houses. The Amur River Society organised a school for training in professional espionage, whose agents were engaged in intelligence on the actions of the Russian Empire and worked against it in Russia, Manchuria, Korea and China. With the direct assistance of Kokuryūkai, gangs of Chinese militarists (the most famous of whom was Zhang Zuolin) were created in north-eastern China to fight Russian and Soviet influence. Following the pan-Asian ideas it preached, the Kokuryūkai provided financial and other assistance to revolutionaries in East Asia, such as Sun Yat-sen in China and Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippines. The organisation was also in close contact with various Buddhist organisations and sects in Asian countries. In recent years, the Amur River Society's agent networks have enveloped almost the entire world, operating in Turkey, Morocco, Ethiopia, South-east Asia, South America, Europe and the United States, among others."

 NW_JAP_looser.0.t: "Totalitarianism Is a Moral Bankrupt"
 NW_JAP_looser.0.d: "The totalitarian idea that has captured the minds of most politicians of our country in recent years in the course of the real test - total war. And though it sounds paradoxical, this test proved that totalitarianism could not cope with such a total war. Now it is time for it to leave the political scene and give way to other ideologies. To do this, the first thing we need to do is to amend the Meiji constitution to ensure that such experiments are not repeated."
 NW_JAP_looser.0.a: "Democracy Rises from Oblivion!"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.t: "Reneissance of Parliamentary Parties"
 NW_JAP_looser.1.d: "The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has become a vivid testimony to the unsustainability of the idea of a one-party state - now it is time to destroy it in order to continue on the path of democratisation of Japan. Since the original members of the Association were almost all members of the old parliamentary parties, they are now going to recreate them, but under new names. Thus, Rikken Seiyūkai will now be called the Conservative Party, Rikken Minseitō - the Progressive Party, and Shakai Taishuto - the Social Democratic Party. Nakano's supporters, on the other hand, took the name Toho Jikai."
 NW_JAP_looser.1.a: "The Experiment Is Obviously a Failure"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.t: "Victory of Rikken Minseitō"
 NW_JAP_looser.2.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again"- such a sarcastic comment was received on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Rikken Minseitō party won the election, as it had won several previous elections in a row. However, political elites were reluctant to trust its leader to run the country - and perhaps that is what brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.2.a: "Well this time it looks like the party has a chance to form a cabinet..."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.t: "Victory of the Progressive Party"
 NW_JAP_looser.3.d: ""The National Diet elections are looking more and more like a man stepping on a rake, then stepping back and stepping on it again" - such a sarcastic comment was Victory of Rikken Minseitōreceived on the results of the parliamentary elections in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. The Progressive Party, which is made up of members of the former Rikken Minseitō, which has won a majority in the last few elections, won this election as well. However, political elites were reluctant to entrust its leader with running the country - and it is possible that this is what has brought Japan to where it is today."
 NW_JAP_looser.3.a: "But now, in a modified form, the party has a chance to form a cabinet!"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.t: "Tanzan Ishibashi"
 NW_JAP_looser.4.d: "Despite all the repression and arrests of many scholars, there remained one unbreakable bastion of free speech: the journals Oriental Economic Review and the English-language Oriental Economist. Their editor-in-chief was Tanzan Ishibashi, a philosophy graduate of Waseda University who began writing for the journals in the late 1910s, commenting on the Japanese government's financial policies.\n\nDuring his years as editor, Ishibashi's scathing, liberal commentary on almost every significant event was the subject of almost every editorial. Although Ishibashi was widely known as a liberal, government officials highly valued his economic expertise and constantly called upon him as an independent expert and advisor to the government on economic issues.\n\nUntil the last moment, he resisted the ideology of militarism, totalitarianism, and colonialism. Instead, he advocated a "Little Japan" policy that favoured abandoning Manchuria and Japanese colonies in order to refocus efforts on Japan's own economic and cultural development. Despite these ultra-liberal values, his expert ability allowed him to continue to speak his mind even in the harshest of times.\n\nRikken MinseitōNow, after his words about the need to abandon colonies and the dangers of military influence on politics and expansion into China were confirmed in their truest sense, Tanzan decided to step out of journalism and expert judgement and into politics. To do so, he agreed to join and lead Rikken Minseitō, as its positions are the closest to Tanzan's own."
 NW_JAP_looser.4.a: "Welcome back, Ishibashi-san!"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.t: "Minor Japanism"
 NW_JAP_looser.5.d: "Tanzan Ishibashi was the editor-in-chief of the journals  became an opportunity during the years of repression for many other journalists, academics and analysts to express their thoughts without fear of being arrested by the security services for doing so. This was done thanks to the fact that their articles remained anonymous. Ishibashi's own moral and expert authority allowed him to publish all this and not get his journals banned."
 NW_JAP_looser.5.a: "The state should always have a stop valve, Ishibashi is it."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.t: "Mass Pardon"
 NW_JAP_looser.6.d: "Today the Emperor, on the advice of the Prime Minister, issued a decree pardoning many political prisoners, including scientists, cultural figures and even some radical politicians. There was no cancellation of the Peace Preservation Law, but now this 'gesture on the part of the emperor' will make the security services think twice when they want to arrest some other 'unreliable person'.."
 NW_JAP_looser.6.a: "Truly the prime minister we deserve..."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.t: "Resumption of the Activities of Kingorō Hashimoto"
 NW_JAP_looser.7.d: "The relentless Colonel Hashimoto, who had been disturbing the constitutional order of the state since the early 30s, has resumed his activities again - his organisation, practically a personal army, is beginning to swell dramatically with a large number of new supporters from among the demobilised military who cannot find themselves in civilian life. If we don't try to turn the situation around, with the low stability and high popularity of his ideas, he will succeed in overthrowing the current government and installing one that will not take such radical action against the army."
 NW_JAP_looser.7.a: "We'll keep an eye on it."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.t: "Mass Rallies in the Streets"
 NW_JAP_looser.8.d: "Today, discontent with the government has taken to the streets as many politicians feared. The main problem is that these are now ex-military men who can handle weapons and are willing to take risks. They are the ones Hashimoto is betting on - the tension, instability, and clashes on the streets have been there for a long time, but now it has erupted into a mass protest demanding the resignation of the government."
 NW_JAP_looser.8.a: "We have to try to suppress them!"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.t: "Hashimoto's Coup"
 NW_JAP_looser.9.d: "The government's attempted suppression of mass rallies throughout the capital led to more riots and the eventual storming of the parliament building and other government offices. The protesters were led by Hashimoto's men, who demanded the formation of a government led by Shūmei Ōkawa, a close friend of Kingorō since before the war." 
 NW_JAP_looser.9.a: "There's nothing left to do but agree to his demands."
 NW_JAP_looser.10.t: "Konoe and his Friends"
 NW_JAP_looser.10.d: "Unexpectedly for many, Konoe behaved graciously towards many of those convicted in political cases in the 1930s: as military conspirators, ultra-nationalist politicians and even communists (convicted under the Peace Protection Act) - most of whom have been granted amnesty today. This is hardly indicative of a move towards the abolition of the Peace Protection Act, as those who know Konoe well could have expected such an outcome - there was always room for a few communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers in his circle of close friends."
 NW_JAP_looser.10.a: "An attempt to draw a line between past and new times."
 NW_JAP_looser.11.t: "Wrong Prediction"
 NW_JAP_looser.11.d: "For a long time, in all the texts that Ishiwara wrote and his supporters replicated, the 'Final' or 'Last' War was seen as inevitable. In a sense, the 'Final War' was supposed to be a religious war leading to the inevitable victory of Nichiren Buddhism, the desired end result. However, Ishiwara, defending Japan's unrivalled freedom of religion, insisted that he would never use the force of the state or law to suppress Christianity or Pure Land Buddhism, believing that religion would be unified through persuasion and debate. While Ishiwara and his supporters described the last war as a prerequisite for the global spread of Nichiren Buddhism, they ultimately left extremely vague how this would happen in practice. After the heavy defeat in China, a growing number of East Asian League members questioned the extent to which this war was desirable or obligatory. Today, this most radical element of the ideology of Nichirenism has finally fallen - the East Asia League now recognises pacifism, and Ishiwara himself made a statement to journalists during which he said that he 'recognises' that his prediction of a final war between Asia and the West 'was a profound conceit and actually a mistake'."
 NW_JAP_looser.11.a: "At Least, there will be peace in Japan."
 NW_JAP_looser.12.t: "The Japanese Are Offering a Truce"
 NW_JAP_looser.12.d: "Diplomats of the Empire of Japan have conveyed to us, through a third country, a proposal for a possible armistice. The Japanese Government has fulfilled its purposes and does not wish to wage war with us any further.\n\nThey naturally assume that our part of our overseas colonies will be ceded to Japan or its collaborator governments as a result of the agreement."
 NW_JAP_looser.12.a: "We'll fight for this land!"
 NW_JAP_looser.12.b: "Let's make peace now."
 NW_JAP_looser.13.t: "Refusal to Negotiate"
 NW_JAP_looser.13.d: "Our peace proposal has not been heeded by our current enemies in the war. Apparently, they want to lose more territory."
 NW_JAP_looser.13.a: "Maybe then they'll agree."
 NW_JAP_looser.14.t: "Adoption of Esperanto"
 NW_JAP_looser.14.d: "The Empire of Japan has decided to adopt Esperanto as the new lingua franca for all members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This should strengthen the pan-Asian spirit of our countries, since not just the languages of different Asian countries differ greatly, but also the writing itself. Esperanto will thus become the universal language of communication among the nations of Asia. This gesture is very favourable on their part, as one would have expected a demand for the adoption of Japanese."
 NW_JAP_looser.14.a: "We will join the Esperantist zone of the lingua franca!"
 NW_JAP_looser.14.b: "Our country is too poor right now to spend extra money on this."
 
 NW_JAP.0.t: "Meeting at the Takaratai Restaurant"
 NW_JAP.0.d: "It is impossible to deny at this moment the tremendous successes of the Bolshevik economic program and the first five-year plan. A real threat looms over Manchuria because of the increased numbers of armored troops, aviation, and artillery now available to the Red Army.\n\n\n\n/n Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, leader of the Manchurian Military Faction and initiator of the Manchurian Incident, gathered several key officers from the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff at the Takaretai Restaurant in Tokyo. It was he who, after the recent assassination of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzan, who was the leader of the Toseiha faction and the initiator of the project of industrialization and militarization of the Japanese economy, suddenly took his place - the main mover of the project of modernization of Japanese industry and the army.\n\n\n\n It can be said that after this meeting, even the most skeptical representatives of the generals and officers in general began to agree with the far-reaching conclusions of the two colonels - the living and the dead."
 NW_JAP.0.a: "This is despite the difference in other political views of all these people"
 NW_JAP.1.t: "Five-Year Plan for Japanese and Manchurian Industries"
 NW_JAP.1.d: "After the death by katana of Colonel Nagata Tetsuzana the previous fall, Ishiwara took the even more important step of systematically planning for future war. Among the unpleasant surprises he encountered when he joined the General Staff, his discovery was that there was no coordinated study of Japan's economic potential, either government or private. In addition, the army lacked the expertise to conduct such a survey. He took on such a task, which entailed processing a vast sea of statistical data into clear budgetary and administrative proposals and assuming responsibility for economic planning, and formed his own think tank, the Japan-Japan Association for Financial and Economic Research. He chose an old acquaintance from the Mantetsu Company - Miyazaki Masayoshi - to head the organization. Despite the fact that the Association was based in Japan, it received strong material support from Manchuria. Through the good offices of Itagaki Seishiro, who was Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army at the end of 1935, Mantetsu President Yosuke Matsuoku was persuaded to allocate half of the Association's budget of two million yen from company funds. The other half was secretly supplied by the General Staff itself."
 NW_JAP.1.a: "And who is Miyazaki?"
 NW_JAP.2.t: "The Miyazaki Group"
 NW_JAP.2.d: "Mr. Miyazaki is an interesting figure. He was born in Ishikawa Prefecture and was sent as a student to study in Russia just before the Great War. In Moscow during the revolution, he became interested in Marxist theory and the contradictions of capitalism, though without any obvious political leanings in that direction. He returned to Japan to work at Mantetsu, but in the second half of the twenties was again in Moscow to study Soviet economic planning, the general direction and possibilities of which apparently interested him deeply. In the thirties, returning to Japan as head of the research department of the Mitsui Bank, he acquired a solid reputation as an analyst and planner. In doing so, however, he found himself little connected to a group of so-called "reformist bureaucrats" with similar political views to his own. Despite this, Ishiwara's brain trust ended up with just such a shortened name, the 'Miyazaki Group'."
 NW_JAP.2.a: "We'll keep an eye on this man"
 NW_JAP.3.t: "Opening of the National Parliament Building"
 NW_JAP.3.d: "For the first 50 years of its existence, the Sejm met in various temporary premises, because for a long time the government could not decide what form the building built especially for this purpose should take. The first projects appeared already in the 1880s, but they were designed by German architects, which caused rejection from the majority of the public, demanding to get rid of "international" architecture for such an important symbol of Japan. In 1898, the famous American architect Ralph Adams Cram proposed a more "oriental" design of the building with tiled roofs and a large wall and gate enclosure. However, this design was rejected after the fall of Ito Hirobumi, who was the main proponent of the plan. The next two temporary structures died under similar circumstances, in 1890 and 1925, from fires caused by poor electrical wiring. As early as 1910, the Ministry of Finance set up a commission in an attempt to take control of the new parliament building project, as the Ministry of the Interior was clearly not up to the task. Prime Minister Katsura Taro led the commission, which recommended that the new building should emulate the Italian Renaissance architectural style. This recommendation was criticized by many who felt the choice was too arbitrary.\n\n\nIn 1918, the ministry sponsored a public design competition, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, came up with a design where the building ended in a "pyramid," reflecting modern hybrid architecture than purely European or Asian designs. Construction began in 1920, but was monstrously delayed by the Kanto earthquake and financial crises."
 NW_JAP.3.a: "But today, we can finally open a permanent parliament building!"
 NW_JAP.4.t: "A Message to All Citizens"
 NW_JAP.4.d: ""- -...He played a central role in the organization of the nation as an unbroken emperor of unbroken lineage. Today the world stands at the apex of historical change, with the collapse of order and the rise of disasters. It is a mission, to eliminate the idea of "constitutional politics, which can be interpreted as the politics of political party conflict," which is an "afterglow of Western thought," and to "unite all people according to the spirit of unity." All political parties will soon wake up..... and if even some idiots neglect it, the day will come when the existing political parties will be crushed by the iron rule of history. And that day is certainly not far off.\n\n\nThis proclamation was read by thousands of people across the country today. It was authored by retired Navy colonel and member of the House of Peers Sanetaka Ichijo, who worked closely with renowned ultranationalist ideologue Mitsura Toyama and Admiral Eisuke Yamamoto."
 NW_JAP.4.a: "How many more of these nonsensical proclamations will there be?"
 NW_JAP.5.t: "Anti-Communist Defense Group"
 NW_JAP.5.d: "Representatives of the One Party Movement continue to self-organize: today one of them, Tamakichi Nakamizo, together with his supporters, announced the formation of the so-called Anti-Communist Defense Group. Despite its name, it is believed to be primarily aimed at establishing totalitarian rule in the country and getting rid of parliamentary politics. Its leader, Nakamizo, is associated with many old political adventurers and conspirators. His friends include many current members of the Diet, and some even suggest that he is in the entourage of the powerful and ambitious Prince Konoe."
 NW_JAP.5.a: "We'll keep an eye on them"
 NW_JAP.6.t: "The Death of Eiichi Baba"
 NW_JAP.6.d: "One of the most important proponents of the "national defense state" project, renowned finance expert Baba Eiichi died today of a myocardial infarction. He was famous for many important actions in various positions in government, from seeking compromises between political parties and factions in parliament to important efforts to improve the financial situation in rural areas after the onset of the economic crisis."
 NW_JAP.6.a: "It's a blow to the state...national defense"
 NW_JAP.7.t: "Tōhōkai Creation"
 NW_JAP.7.d: "The radical Kokumin Dōmei party, which was formed in 1932 by former Interior Minister Adachi Kenzo from members of the Rikken Minsaito party, has itself begun to disintegrate after the last election. As recently as last year, some Kokumin Dōmei members returned to the Minsateito, and today one of the party's leaders, Seigo Nakano, stopped agreeing with Kenzo's views and announced that he and his supporters were leaving Kokumin Domei and forming a new party, Tōhōkai. Another important Kokumin Dōmei leader, Akira Kazami, also announced his withdrawal from the party."
 NW_JAP.7.a: "Such leaders can't live in the same party."
 NW_JAP.8.t: "Kazushige Ugaki's Illness."
 NW_JAP.8.d: "Medical teams began arriving at the Prime Minister's residence in the evening. Kazushige Ugaki is ill. At first it seemed that hospitalization could have been avoided, but for the additional safety of the prime minister's health, the consilium decided to hospitalize him in order to conduct a full examination and closely monitor the patient's condition.\n\nThis is exactly what the prime minister himself expected, so he had a plan for it. At least temporarily, he would retire. In doing so, the general advised the emperor to appoint a general from Ugaki's entourage as prime minister so as not to destroy the system of keeping the military out of power."
 NW_JAP.8.a: "Get well soon, General!"
 NW_JAP.9.t: "Ugaki has been Treated."
 NW_JAP.9.d: "General Ugaki has fully recovered from his illness. The unnecessary reassurance in the form of hospitalization was useful - Ugaki gained new strength for further actions in politics."
 NW_JAP.9.a: "The situation has stabilized"
 NW_JAP.10.t: "The Arrest of the Communist Academy"
 NW_JAP.10.d: "A Shizuoka Shimbun newspaper journalist arrested two weeks ago gave his testimony during interrogation. According to him, two groups of people, about 60 in total, had established a communist cell to educate people in Marxist ideas, similar to organizations that existed within the Soviet Union and in other countries with the support of the Comintern.\n\nThis group includes 32 scholars and researchers who participated in the writing of " Lecture on the History of the Development of Japanese Capitalism," a work that began an active debate in the political left between proponents of the two views of Japanese history - whether or not it had already passed the stage of bourgeois-democratic revolution.\n\nThe remaining members of the group are members of various leftist cultural organizations: writers and filmmakers."
 NW_JAP.10.a: "They should be arrested immediately!"
 NW_JAP.11.t: "Establishment of the Japan Proletarian Party"
 NW_JAP.11.d: "Kanjū Katō, elected as a deputy from leftist workers' organizations in the 1936 election, suggested that Mosaburō Suzuki, founder of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party, join forces. Both had long been known as fighters against the country's growing militarism. Previous attempts to create a mass left-wing party had failed - either they could not gain popularity or were thwarted by the government. Katō Kanjū was chosen as the head of the new party, as the party itself was claimed to be the "political wing of the labor movement" and Katō is the chairman of the left-wing trade union federation. Moreover, the party proclaims as one of its tasks "the establishment of a Popular Front for the struggle against fascism and war in Japan." The successful practice of such broad political coalitions of left-wing forces around the world seems to have reached Japan."
 NW_JAP.11.a: "Let's see what comes out this time"
 NW_JAP.12.t: "Rumors about the Popular Front"
 NW_JAP.12.d: "The leaders of the Japan Proletarian Party are thinking of forming a Popular Front against war with China - for this purpose, they have offered the head of the party Shakai Taishūtō, who has much greater popularity to form a coalition. And this is what poses the greatest danger if they suddenly agree with the arguments of the Japan Proletarian Party. In this situation, we can use the Peace Preservation Law to arrest all the overly radical leftist politicians."
 NW_JAP.12.a: "That's what we're gonna do"
 NW_JAP.13.t: "Popular Front Incident"
 NW_JAP.13.d: "Katō Kanjū and other members of the Japan Proletarian Party were among the 400 arrested as a result of the "Popular Front Incident" (Yamakawa Hitoshi, Arahata Kanson, Minobe Ryokichi), and the party itself was banned. The prosecutor's office officially declared that the Japan Proletarian Party was engaged in the dissemination of "anti-war ideas" at the behest of the Comintern, its final goal was "to change the state system of Japan through communist revolution," and those arrested were "active on the basis of the Comintern Popular Front line.""
 NW_JAP.13.a: "Repression is gaining momentum"
 NW_JAP.14.t: "The Popular Front's Second Incident"
 NW_JAP.14.d: "Today, additional arrests were made in the Popular Front case - 38 professors from Tokyo Imperial University, who were involved in teaching economics, were put behind bars. However, this incident is already regarded with disbelief by many, as they suspect that the arrests, which occurred very late, are related to the personal proceedings of university employees, some of whom were informants for the intelligence services."
 NW_JAP.14.a: "Is the situation getting out of control?"
 NW_JAP.15.t: "A Brutal Murder in Oga District"
 NW_JAP.15.d: "This morning at a hotel in Tokyo's Oga district, the mutilated body of a man was found in one of the rooms - his genitals were missing. The police found out rather quickly that the murdered man was Kichizō Ishida, the 42-year-old owner of the Yoshidaya fish restaurant. In addition, the phrase "We, Sada and Kichi Ishida, are alone" was written in blood on his left thigh as well as on a sheet. Also, a hieroglyph meaning the name "Sada" was carved on his left hand.\n\nIt was reported from the hotel management that he was staying here with prostitute Sada Abe, who was the last person to see him until he left the hotel at 8am, telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.\n\nSuch circumstances led to the story being picked up by newspapers and journalists, which had already become national news - literally causing panic across the country as frantic people began searching for the murder suspect. Police have received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a crush in the Ginza neighborhood. In reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo - the February 26 incident, the crime was satirically named the "May 18 Incident.""
 NW_JAP.15.a: "Who could have committed such a brutal crime?"
 NW_JAP.16.t: "The Killer's been Found"
 NW_JAP.16.d: "The medical examination concluded that Ishida had been killed by strangulation, and that he had lost his genitals afterward. The search for the killer continued until the police arrived at a hotel in the Shinagawa district where a suspicious girl with a strange name was staying.\n\n- Don't be so formal, - she told them, - you're looking for Sada Abe, right? Well, that's me. I'm Sada Abe.\n\nHowever, the police were not convinced they had found their target, whereupon the girl showed Ishida's genitals as evidence. No further corroboration was needed. Abe was arrested and interrogated for eight sessions. When asked why she cut off Ishido's genitals, she said, "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that gave me the most vivid memories." The officer conducting the interrogation was struck by Abe's behavior when asked why she killed Ishido. "Immediately she became agitated, and her eyes flashed strangely in some way." Her answer was as is: "I loved him so much, I wanted him to be all for me. But since we weren't husband and wife while he was alive, he could be held by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could touch him anymore, so I killed him....."

 NW_JAP.17.t: "Sada Abe's trial"
 NW_JAP.17.d: "By 5 a.m., crowds were already gathering outside the courthouse to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details surrounding the trial, but made sure that the proceedings were conducted with the utmost seriousness. Abe's statement before sentencing began, "What I regret most about this incident is that I have been misunderstood - as some kind of sexual pervert... I have never had a man in my life like Ishido who loved and slept with without taking money, but none of them made me feel the way I felt about him." Abe was convicted of murder and mutilation of a corpse. Although the prosecution demanded ten years and Abe claimed she wanted the death penalty, she was actually sentenced to only six years in prison.\n\nThe police report of Abe's interrogation and confession became a national bestseller this year. When details of the crime were made public, rumors spread that Ishido's penis was of extraordinary big size. However, the police officer who questioned the killer after his arrest denied this, saying, "Ishido's was just average. She told me: 'Size does not make a man in bed. The technique and his desire to give me pleasure was what I liked."\n\nThe person most affected by the story (not counting the murdered man) was Goro Omiya, Abe's first lover, a professor and banker who had hoped to become a member of the Seimas, but whose political career was naturally ruined after journalists published all the details of the story in the newspapers."

 NW_JAP.18.t: "The First Anniversary of Hachiko's Death"
 NW_JAP.18.d: "Hachiko was born on November 10, 1923 in the Japanese prefecture of Akita. A farmer decided to give the puppy to Professor Hidesaburo Ueno, who worked at Tokyo Imperial University. The professor gave the puppy the name Hachiko - from the Japanese words "hachi" and "ko", the second meaning attachment or dependence, and the first because the dog was the professor's eighth dog.\n\nAs Hachiko grew older, he followed his owner everywhere he went. Professor would go to the city every day for work, so Hachiko would first walk him to the entrance of Shibuya Station and then return at 3 p.m. to meet his master. On May 21, 1925, a professor at the university had a stroke. Doctors could not save his life, and he never returned home. Hachiko was eighteen months old at the time. That day he never waited for his master, but he began to come to the station every day, patiently waiting for him until late in the evening. He spent the night on the porch of the professor's house.\n\nDespite attempts to place the dog in the homes of the professor's friends and relatives, he invariably kept returning to the station. Local shopkeepers and railroad workers fed Hachiko, admiring his persistence. The dog became famous throughout Japan in 1932 after an article published in one of the largest newspapers in Tokyo entitled "A loyal old dog awaits the return of his owner, who died seven years ago". The story won the hearts of the Japanese people, and curious people started coming to Shibuya Station to see the dog.\n\nApril 21, 1934 Hachiko was erected a monument, at the opening of which he personally attended. But exactly one year ago, the faithful dog died, he was found not far from the station - the autopsy showed that he had cancer in the last stage. It shocked people then. Today, on the first anniversary of his death, a large and diverse crowd gathered at Shibuya Station to honor his memory."

 NW_JAP.19.t: "Genro's Retirement"
 NW_JAP.19.d: "The last genrō of Saionji Kinmochi decided to retire after serving the state for a long time - Kinmochi had been associated with high politics for almost his entire life, starting as far back as the Meiji Revolution. His most important role was when he himself was prime minister, but equally important was his work as a genrō, especially when he was the last remaining genrō after 1924, as he had to advise the emperor on the appointment of a new prime minister.\n\nThe last few years have proved that with the onset of old age (Kinmochi is over 85 years old) he is no longer able to cope with his role - political instability has reached a level that the country has probably never experienced before. Realizing this, the genrō decided to retire from all government posts, thus eliminating the very institution of the genrōrat and going to live a quiet life on his estate."

 NW_JAP.21.t: "Why is Saito Silent?"
 NW_JAP.21.d: "Despite the fact that a full-scale war with the Republic of China has begun, many newspaper readers and people who follow politics closely wonder why Rikken Minseitō MP Saito Takao, a well-known critic of militarism, is silent. People write letters to him, who knows his address, and to newspapers and other deputies. To stem this flow of incomprehensible cries, an announcement was made in several metropolitan newspapers by Rikken Minseitō party members and close friends of Saito that he is now in recovery from a suspected stroke, since he unluckily stumbled and fell on the stairs a few months ago. However, he continues to keep a close eye on the situation in the world and the country as he prepares to return to his regular activities."
 NW_JAP.21.a: "People respect Saito"
 NW_JAP.22.t: "Saito's Anti-War Speech"
 NW_JAP.22.d: "The elderly Saito Takao once again went to the Seimas podium to make his speech. The head of the party, Machida Chūji, tried to prevent him from speaking when he learned of the content of the speech, but he could do nothing - party discipline was already too low. Another speech once again stretched on for long, shrill minutes.\n\nThe main points of the speech were as follows: the situation with the Chinese incident and ways out of it, does the current government understand exactly what is the best way to deal with it; secondly, what is the content of the so-called construction of a new order in East Asia; thirdly, in view of the history of wars in the world, can it be achieved world peace in addition to peace in the East; fourthly, a few questions about the Chinese governments in the territories controlled by our army; Fifth, a warning to the current Cabinet by discussing the government's responsibility for the start of the Chinese incident.\n\nThe room was quiet during the speech, with only a few cries from small and medium-sized groups, the rest of the room was quiet and there was occasional applause. "But there seemed to be a vague unease in the room," were the comments Saito made to reporters after the meeting. Saito recited almost his entire speech from memory - he had devoted several weeks to creating and memorizing it."
 NW_JAP.22.a: "Saito is relevant as ever"
 NW_JAP.23.t: "Consequences of Speech"
 NW_JAP.23.d: "After the speech, the Jikyoku Doshikai and Shakai Taishuto parties made a statement that Saito's speech offended the purpose of the Japanese Empire's movement in Asia. This was answered by Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader], The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications, but Saito was not satisfied with their answers. In addition, the Minister of War did not respond, although this was what the MP was most looking forward to.\n\nThis is because the Army's position was divided. The Minister of War was on the side of those who really thought that the Chinese incident had gone on long enough. So he didn't answer anything officially, but after the meeting he personally told Saito, "I'm impressed. You're pretty good at what you say." But the head of the Political Affairs Department of the East Asian Development Council and the head of the Military Affairs Bureau, who listened to the speech as members of the government looked at each other with wry smiles and said quietly, "Saito would say something like that."\n\nIn addition, Matsutoshi Koyama, Speaker of the House of Representatives and member of the Rikken Minseitō, spoke, saying: "There is no one who knows the purpose of war in the spiritual movement." He also wrote it down and gave it to Misao Ōki, the chief secretary of the House of Representatives, and ordered him to secretly delete about two-thirds of the entire speech, or about 10,000 words, that were particularly critical of the military. Although Ōki resisted, he finally conceded to Koyama."
 NW_JAP.23.a: "The scandal is gaining ground"
 NW_JAP.24.t: "The Split in Rikken Minseitō"
 NW_JAP.24.d: "When the attack on Saito began, the Minseito Party leadership hastily worked with the army to try to resolve the situation by removing the content of Saito's speech from the stenographic transcript. Saito visited Chairman Koyama with senior party members and his friends and said: "If the army is unhappy with the content of the speech, why didn't War Minister Shunroku Hata respond to it?".\n\nHowever, because of the delay in the removal procedure, some local newspapers published all of Saito's anti-war speeches the next day, and the anti-war speeches in the Japanese parliament became known all over the world. Right now, reports about it are being printed in Chinese and American newspapers.\n\nRikken Minseitō members, seeing that the military and others continued to attack Saito, tried to force Saito to "voluntarily resign," but he flatly refused, suggesting that they "accept it as inevitable." As a result, it was decided to send Saito Takao to a Disciplinary Committee headed by the Seimas Speaker."
 NW_JAP.24.a: "Let's see where this goes"
 NW_JAP.25.t: "Meeting of the Disciplinary Committee"
 NW_JAP.25.d: "Discussions have begun on Saito Takao's act within the parties as a vote is expected on his expulsion from the current House of Representatives caucus. The Nakajima Faction of the Rikken Seiyūkai Party, Jikyoku Dōshikai and Shakai Taishūtō have united in support of punishment, while the majority of the Kuhara Seiyūkai Faction appears to be against the punishment. The Minseitō Party is holding a secret meeting of representatives to discuss the issue, but the majority of the party is in opposition, and it doesn't look like this will be easily resolved due to the hot debate over the attacks on the leaders.\n\nIn his defense before the committee, Saito described the process that led to the question and speech and the general content of the speech, and then broke down the seven reasons for punishment presented by the Seiyūkai Nakajima faction, one by one, with counterarguments. In addition, the complainant was completely indignant and could not respond to a single word of the accused deputy.\n\nVoting followed, the results of which were distributed as follows. There were 167 empty seats in the Seimas, or less than a third of lawmakers decided not to attend. The Rikken Minseitō Party ended the party debate in favor of exclusion, but Kyujiro Okazaki, close to Saito, opposed exclusion and left the party. He was the only Democrat to vote against it. Of the remaining 170 members, 69, or more than 40%, were absent or abstained. In the Rikken Seiyūkai, 27 of the 71 members of the Kuhara faction abstained or were absent, and 5, the largest number of any faction, were opposed. 16 of 97 members of the Nakajima faction, which is close to the military, and 4 of 10 members of the Konko faction abstained or were absent. Of the 34 members of the pro-war Shakai Taishūtō party, 10 abstained or were absent. 5 of 30 members of the Jikyoku Doshikai abstained. Of the 10 independent members, 1 objected and 7 abstained. The result of the vote was a total of 303 votes, 296 in favor and 7 against, and the expulsion was confirmed."
 NW_JAP.25.a: "Goodbye, Mr. Saito"
 NW_JAP.26.t: "Party Collapse"
 NW_JAP.26.d: "In comments to journalists, Saito said that he was not upset by the events, as he is confident that he is valued by the electorate and will be able to return to work in the Seimas after the next elections. The consequences for the parliamentary parties were much more severe. This incident clearly showed within each of the parties, not, as it seemed before, only within Rikken Xuekai. Moreover, the tendency to "pact with the military" drove the democratic Rikken Minseitō to the point where it expelled its member from parliament rather than supporting him. This severely undermined her credibility with her constituents and their hopes for parliamentarianism. Shakai Taishūtō was finally overrun by her nationalist faction willing to cooperate with the military - Hisashi Aso achieved his goal and emerged above party founder Abe Isoo, who had virtually withdrawn from political activity. But most importantly, the final vote showed how many members of parliament were unwilling in principle to choose between punishing Saito and supporting him, apparently fearful of threats to them from radicals."

The idea of their own state for this people was defended by one of the officers of the Manchurian army Date Junnosuke, a Japanese, ronin, politician and adventurer, who had long been engaged in various conspiracies mainly in the territory of China, but he was also known for having shot two of his abusers who attacked him when he was still at school. In Japan he was closely associated with radicals such as Shūmei Ōkawa, Ikki Kita and Onisaburo Deguchi. After moving to China, he became a close friend of one of the famous and terrible warlords as Zhang Zongchang, and even made a brotherhood pact with him in 1929 and changed his name to Zhang Zongyuan."

The most likely suspects - agents of counterintelligence of the Kuomintang, who allegedly received information about secret negotiations between Tang and the Japanese military in order to head the puppet government of China. The assassins managed to get right into Tang's house thanks to his predilection for collecting antiques. Having acquired very rare porcelain vases from the Song era, they offered them to the famous politician. It was during the deal that the unfortunate hit came.

The Army asked to end the war diplomatically on milder terms because its main objective was war with the Red Army in the Soviet Far East and to fight it it was necessary to avoid an endless war of attrition in China. The Foreign Minister, however, strongly disagrees with the Army. According to him, there is no hope for Troutman's mediation because of the great difference of opinion between China and Japan."

In a statement, Konoe said: "We will not deal with the Nationalist government" and ordered the Ambassador to China, Shigeru Kawagoe, to return to Japan. In response, the Nationalist government also decided to summon the ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiyin, back home. As a result, diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed and the Japanese government essentially voluntarily refused to negotiate with the Kuomintang government. Moreover, [FROM.GetLeader] said he hoped for the establishment of "a new Chinese government based on the overthrow of the government of the [CHI.GetLeader]», and then the war could be over. Thus, the attempt to establish negotiations made by the German Ambassador to China, Oskar Trautmann, with the support of some Japanese and Chinese representatives, is thwarted."

 NW_JAP.54.d: "The failed coup attempts in 1931 by the Sakurakai, a secret society in the junior ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army officer corps that promoted a vision of a militaristic totalitarian state socialist system as an alternative to the current corrupt party politics, inspired other groups in the military to make similar plans. Two major ideological factions emerged in the army: the Tōseiha and the Kōdōha, which began to feud with each other. In 1934, a group of five cadets at the Imperial Japanese Army Military Academy, led by two army officers belonging to the radical militarist imperial Kōdōha faction at the academy, worried about the impending loss of their faction's influence over the armed forces after the dismissal of Army Minister Sadao Araki in January 1934, formed their own plan to overthrow the government. However, in early November 1934, the conspiracy was foiled by the intelligence services because information about it was revealed by one of its members. In March 1934, one of the leaders of the first faction, Nagata Tetsuzan, was appointed chief of military affairs at the Ministry of the Army of Japan, which intensified the persecution of the opposing faction. Because of this, Colonel Aizawa Saburō, who shared the views of the young officers of the Imperial Way faction, assassinated Nagata as responsible for the repression in the army.\n\n\n\nIn the present, the trial of the assassin has begun in Tokyo, but his defenders, also members of the Kōdōha , have decided to use it as a platform to promote their ideas."

 NW_JAP.55.t: "In the Middle of a Trial"
 NW_JAP.55.d: "The young officers continue to emphasize Saburō's moral principles, who acted in the interests of the nation and the Emperor. Their defense is based on the fact that the assassinated general was guilty of purges and splitting the army into separate factions, which undermined its combat effectiveness. At the same time, they continued to spread propaganda of their own ideology of "Shōwa restoration" in the courtroom in front of a large media crowd. The trial itself ended with a rather predictable decision - the death penalty for Saburō Aizawa."

And they were unexpectedly won by the opposition Rikken Minseitō party, which before these elections changed its rhetoric to more militaristic in order to gain popularity among the voters. Not least in Minseitō victory was the split in the Seiyūkai after the vote of no confidence: about 20 people left the party and formed the independent Shōwakai group, which continued to support the Okada government."

 NW_JAP.57.d: "Soldiers of the 1st Guards Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army have occupied the grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, as well as, according to information reaching us, many other government offices. Their leaders, a group of young officers belonging to the radical Kokutai Henry-ha faction, similar in its principles to the Kōdōha faction, handed Emperor Hirohito their "Manifesto of Rebellion," in which they put forward their demands for a change in government policy: the dismissal of some of the top officers, and the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki is the leader of the Kōdōha faction in the army and was removed from his position as chief of general staff in the middle of last year by imperial decree."

 NW_JAP.58.d: "The soldiers of the revolted division dispersed to their barracks, but the bloody snow had to be shoveled through the streets of Tokyo for several more hours. It turned out that in parallel with the seizure of the Imperial Palace, detachments of the Guards raided not only various government offices, but first of all, the residences of many politicians, officials and military men who were interfering, in their opinion, with "the rule of the Emperor and the restoration of the greatness of Japan". After a time, it can be stated that there was a de facto coup d'état in the country."
 NW_JAP.58.a: "How dare they..."
 NW_JAP.59.t: "Hirohito's Abdication"
 NW_JAP.59.d: "Without any communication with the outside world, having found himself blocked in his own palace by rebellious Guard units, the emperor had to sign an abdication for himself and his young son. Thus, the throne passed to Hirohito's younger brother Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu, who had been on friendly terms with the army leaders of the Kodoha faction since the early 1930s.\n\n\nIn a long time, until Hirohito could not find his offspring, Yasuhito was considered the heir to the throne, but in 1933 he passed the post to Akihito, the emperor's son. In addition, Prince Chichibu, even after the first attempted military coups in the early 30s, demanded that his older brother introduce direct imperial rule in order to restore order in the country and implement the necessary reforms, so it is unclear how he will develop relations with General Masaki and the coup officers who put him on the throne."

 NW_JAP_news.2.d: "The events that began in the Japanese capital on the night of February 26 may have reached their denouement, or perhaps only approached their climax - de facto the rebels' demands were met and General Jinzaburō Masaki, a leader of one of the army factions who had good relations with the conspirators, was appointed prime minister. However, he is said to have a nasty relationship with the emperor as well as many other members of the political elite. Because of this, it is assumed that the current cabinet will be a temporary one on the way to stabilizing Tokyo. The conspirators have dispersed to their barracks and "they were sort of pardoned," despite the assassination of several politicians of the previous cabinet."

 NW_JAP.60.t: "The Uprising of the Guard in Tokyo"
 NW_JAP.60.d: "In the center of Tokyo, units of the First Guards Infantry Division, which was to be redeployed to Manchuria shortly, rebelled. Several groups of soldiers, led by their officers, seized many government offices, surrounded the Imperial Palace, and began to carry out the liquidation of many politicians, officials, and military officers who were interfering, in their opinion, with "the Emperor's rule and the restoration of Japan's greatness." They delivered their "Rebellion Manifesto" to the Imperial Court, in which they make their political demands: the dismissal of some of the top officers, and the appointment of a new government headed by General Jinzaburō Masaki. Masaki is the leader of the Kōdōha faction in the army and was removed from his post as chief of general staff in the middle of last year by imperial decree. Admiral Keisuke Okada, the country's current prime minister, was among those killed by the rebels, so all power is now in the hands of the emperor."
 NW_JAP.60.a: "This rebellion must be quelled immediately"
 NW_JAP.61.t: "The Military's Procrastination"
 NW_JAP.61.d: "Senior army leaders appear to be uninvolved in the events, as they too are in a state of confusion. In addition, the intra-army confrontation between the two factions (Kōdōha and Tōseiha) is still going on, as both are trying to use the uprising for their own personal goals in order to take down the opposing faction. However, it should be noted that both factions are afraid to call what is happening a "rebellion" or "mutiny" in order not to spoil the reputation of the army and its best units, the Guards, since it was the Guards infantry unit that committed this daring act. Against this background, the Navy's actions look much more dignified. Admiral Yonai, commander-in-chief of the Tokyo Maritime District, has already issued a statement in which he called the rebels "rebel troops," brought about 40 ships into the capital's harbor, took the Maritime Command building under guard, and said that the sailors are ready to defend the Imperial Palace if necessary. \At this time, two groups of forces have formed within the army, offering their own vision of further events: on the one hand, the Supreme Military Council, an unofficial body uniting the leaders of all army leaders, dominated by supporters of the Kōdōha faction. They favor a peaceful resolution to the incident, offering their services as negotiators, including General Masaki, with whom the rebels have confirmed their willingness to negotiate. On the other side is the General Headquarters, where Tōseiha forces are concentrated, who favor decisive action and refusal to negotiate with the rebels."

 NW_JAP.62.d: "General Masaki managed to negotiate with the leaders of the rebels, and they are ready to disperse their units to their barracks if they see the Emperor's official decree to return to their places. However, it should be noted that before this, the members of the Supreme Military Council arbitrarily handed over to the rebels a statement of de facto recognition of their demands, which can be characterized as the Supreme Military Council's solidarity with the rebels.\n\nAt the same time, General Hajime Sugiyama, the head of the General Staff and a staunch supporter of Tōseiha, once again declared that the rebels must be crushed if they are not willing to lay down their arms."
 NW_JAP.62.a: "An imperial decree is out of the question, they have to do it without one"
 NW_JAP.62.b: "All right, the decree will be"
 NW_JAP.63.t: "Time Dragging"
 NW_JAP.63.d: "The Chief of General Staff, General Hajime Sugiyama, despite his steadfast vision of a radical suppression of the coup, made an initial mistake in calling for reinforcements - not knowing the exact number of rebels, he moved too few forces to the capital in case of resistance from the rebels, so the resolution of the incident is again delayed. \n\nMeanwhile, the Emperor himself is becoming increasingly impatient with the army's failure to suppress the rebellion as he had ordered the day before. The fleet's quick response satisfied him, but the army's hesitation was inexplicable to the emperor. When some members of his entourage spoke in defense of the officers' motives, Hirohito angrily replied that "killing my ministers is tantamount to strangling me," and added that the rebels deserved no leniency. At one point Hirohito became so impatient that he threatened to take personal command of the Imperial Guard and order them to attack the rebels themselves."

 NW_JAP.65.t: "The Bloody end of the Putsch"
 NW_JAP.65.d: "Without waiting for his commanders and generals to act, Emperor Hirohito issued a personal decree to immediately suppress the rebellion with forces loyal to the Palace. These included units stationed near Tokyo, soldiers of the Imperial Guard, and Admiral Yonai's marines. The rebels had little chance; about half of them surrendered as soon as the first shots were heard from the government troops, but the rest resisted. All of the rebel leaders died along with their soldiers, whom they condemned to death by their thoughtless actions. However, we still don't know who else was involved in this coup: we can investigate in which one of the army factions will finally try to destroy its rival."

 NW_JAP.67.d: "The young infantry guardsmen's punt was finally resolved when Sugiyama, head of the General Staff, succeeded in getting the rebels to surrender without a fight by spreading the message that the Emperor did not support their demands and demanded an immediate end to the rebellion. Airplanes flew over the rebels scattered propaganda sheets with these words, and negotiators were sent to them. Most of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered. The soldiers dispersed to their barracks and were promised forgiveness if they did so."

He sent loyal naval units to guard the imperial palace, and then distributed his proclamation to the rebels, in which he informed them that the emperor did not support their demands and waited for them to disperse to their barracks. In case of failure to comply with these decrees, the admiral would have to resolve the incident by force using his available shipboard artillery. The bulk of the rebel officers committed seppuku and the rest surrendered. The soldiers dispersed to their barracks and were promised forgiveness if they did so."

 NW_JAP.69.d: "The rebels aimed to assassinate seven major political and military figures who, in their opinion, hindered the development of the state and the emperor's rule. They were the last genro Saionji Kinmochi, Prime Minister Keisuke Okada, politicians Makino Nobuaki, Saitō Makoto, Takahashi Korekiyo and Kantarō Suzuki, and military leader Jyōtarō Watanabe. In the end, Watanabe, Makoto, Korekiyo and, as was believed throughout the incident, Prime Minister Okada were all killed. It turned out that he was saved by his own son-in-law - Colonel Denzo Matsuo, who pretended to be the prime minister, while Okada himself hid in the attic of his residence. The rebels, having killed Matsuo, thought their task was accomplished and did not search the entire building. When the incident was over, the prime minister managed to escape from his hiding place. The emperor now asks Okada to return to his duties, but the admiral feels that he has disgraced himself by allowing the coup to take place, so he feels it necessary to resign and be replaced by someone else."

The last genro who miraculously survived the incident, Saionji Kimmochi, had originally proposed Fumimaro Konoe, but he declined the position due to illness. The emperor was then offered Hirota Kōki, the foreign minister from the previous government, instead. He was a man from a simple family, not belonging to any party or faction, but excelled in his diplomatic duties. Hirohito asked Saionji whether a man of such low prestige should be appointed to the post, but the elderly and liberal-minded genro said it did not matter."
 NW_JAP.70.a: "We'll trust that advice"
 NW_JAP.71.t: "Successful Negotiations with Okada"
 NW_JAP.71.d: "After Emperor Hirohito had a private conversation with Keisuke Okada, in which he spoke about the excellent actions of the fleet during the incident, as well as expressed his personal confidence in the prime minister and asked for help in such a difficult time for the country, the admiral had no choice but to agree to postpone the decision to resign from his post."

However, it is necessary to decide whether this military tribunal will be held in the same way as the previous ones (for example, the January Sabourō Aizawa tribunal), or whether to organize a secret trial in which the defendants will not have the right to legal representation, to call witnesses or to appeal.\n\n\n\nIn the first case, it will certainly be an additional blow to the prestige of the army, but on the other hand, it may allow to return it to the control of the civilian government. However, it could also lead to destabilization of the situation in the country."

 NW_JAP.72.b: "We'll hold a secret trial of the defendants"
 NW_JAP.73.t: "Sentencing"
 NW_JAP.73.d: "The court-martial was protracted due to its openness, as were all previous similar trials. During it, the rebel officers accused of mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the War Minister after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, most of them were found guilty and five were sentenced to death."
 NW_JAP.73.a: "A sad end"
 NW_JAP.74.d: "The trial was held in secret. The judges did not listen to the motives and intentions of the defendants - they only forced them to focus on their actions during their testimony. Thus, the trial was very different from a regular court-martial. The rebel officers charged with mutiny claimed that their actions had been approved by a proclamation issued by the Minister of War after the rebellion began, but they also confirmed that they had never formally presented themselves to the imperial command. In the end, all were found guilty, of whom seventeen were sentenced to death."

 NW_JAP.75.d: "Major General Tomoyuki Yamashita, one of the leading members of the Kōdōha faction, has on several occasions called for leniency towards the rebel officers involved in the coup attempt, but having failed to achieve his goals, he realized that he had lost the Emperor's trust and decided to resign. Some higher officers consider Yamashita to be too skillful a military man, the loss of whom would cause a blow to the fighting ability of our army, and offer to persuade him to stay."

With this gesture, he has already proved that he is very different from his brother, who tried to minimize interference in politics.

A solution was quickly found - a one-time arrest of all officers involved in the February 26 incident by the Kempeitai secret police, so that they would not be able to bring the soldiers back to the streets.

This had not happened since the Meiji era, when the emperor had real power. Since the introduction of the constitution in 1891, emperors have interfered less and less in political life, and the previous Emperor Hirohito was a supporter of British-style monarchy, where the emperor plays a symbolic role and is merely a sovereign uniting the nation.

And if during the 20-ies all these societies were engaged in theoretical developments and almost did not go "into the political environment", rather gathering their supporters, in the early 30-ies Ōkawa "went on the attack". His participation in the Manchurian Incident, which ended with the creation of Manchukuo, is hard to underestimate, given the more than a hundred lectures he gave around the country on the importance of capturing this piece of China. In parallel, preparations were underway for coups d'état in Tokyo, several attempts at which failed, eventually leading to Ōkawa's arrest and imprisonment. One of these attempts was supposed to have involved General Araki, the founder of the Kodoha faction. However, he served only about a year instead of the 7 years he was supposed to serve, and was released through collusion with the authorities. But now that General Masaki has come to power and lost control over a group of young officers who continue to demand radical reforms, the conservative generals in Kōdōha have no choice but to recall their old ties with Ōkawa and offer him a new deal: to enter the Kōdōha military."

 NW_JAP.85.d: "Prince Naruhiko, who took power in the country, addressed the nation with his statement. He tried to make it in the clearest possible form and called himself 'the guarantor of the imperial house.' He said that all the events that had taken place in the country after February 26 were the fruit of the Imperial Army conspirators who had long been trying to destabilize the country against the Emperor's opinion and wanted to "return the political system to the days of the Shogunate" in order to rule indiscriminately, deceiving ordinary people with beautiful promises. Now the prince has taken matters into his own hands and declared a period of state of emergency, necessary to restore order in the country and establish economic and political life."

 NW_JAP_news.20.d: "Emperor Hirohito's uncle, Prince Naruhiko, was the man who was finally able to take matters into his own hands, remove the conspirators who had come to power in a military mutiny in late February, and restore legitimate authority to the country. He made an address to the nation through journalists and radio, where he called himself "the guarantor of the imperial house" and declared that all the events that had occurred in the country were the fruit of a conspiracy of people who wanted to restore the system of the Shogunate period, to prevent the emperor from caring for the nation and leading it to prosperity. He explicitly called them conspirators and people who had committed treason against the emperor. He also declared a national state of emergency to restore order and capture all those involved in this heinous crime."

 NW_JAP.88.t: "A Categorical Refusal by the Chinese Side"
 NW_JAP.88.d: "In spite of the mutually beneficial proposals for cooperation that we offered, the Chinese representatives flatly refused to discuss such agreements. Probably the main obstacle for them was the clause on the recognition of Manchukuo-Go."

 NW_JAP.89.d: "The Japanese government wishes to acquire an iron ore mine on the territory of our country through a state-owned company. The Japanese Empire has always been short of minerals, but as we know steel is one of the most important resources for warfare. Therefore, by preventing the Japanese from making the intended purchase, we can temper their ardor."

 NW_JAP.92.d: "It is time for China and Japan to resolve the Mongolian issue and the fate of several state entities in Inner Mongolia. At the moment there are two parallel governments there - pro-China and pro-Japanese.

 NW_JAP.92.a: "Let's hope the Mongols abide by this decision"
 NW_JAP.93.t: "Restoring Relations with Japan"
 NW_JAP.93.d: "Since the Republic of China has recently concluded an agreement with the Empire of Japan, establishing allied relations with it, reaffirming the joint struggle against communism in Asia, and thus recognizing the independence of Manchukuo-Go, it becomes necessary for the other world powers to take this step as well, despite attempts to isolate Japan diplomatically after the seizure of Manchuria."

After that, they held a press conference with journalists from the world's leading publications. At the end of the meeting, the leaders arrived at the coast of the city, where they held a ceremonial laying of the new Statue of Liberty - in honor of friendship between the Japanese and American peoples.

 NW_JAP.100.d: "Relations between the United States and the Empire of Japan have been strained since 1931, when the Japanese military invaded China and proclaimed Manchukuo-Go with the deposed Emperor Pu Yi at its head. However, the volume of mutual trade between the countries remained high as before. First of all, this was due to Japan's material dependence on foreign countries.\n\n\nThe next, in 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. Several attempts at peace talks then failed, and a few years later the war reached a stalemate - the Japanese could not effectively subdue the invaded territories, the Chinese could not regain their land. At the same time, both sides continued to stand on their negotiating positions. The current, new Japanese government has set its goal to achieve a resolution of the "Chinese incident," as they call it, with the support of our country. This is necessary to restore good-neighborly relations between us, restore trade and end the endless hostilities."

Also today, journalits reported that Japanese troops had dramatically increased their numbers into Indochina and occupied the southern part of Indochina. The Japanese government has not commented on this situation in any way, but reports from the field indicate that it was the unauthorised prank of another Japanese general, which was swallowed by the Japanese government. Both the resources of Indochina and its strategic location as a springboard for attacking other Asian colonies of European powers are now under Japanese control."

The Japanese ambassador also said that if the supporters of the peace talks fail to fulfil their aspirations, the supporters of war with the United States will finally take power in the country, and then tragedy will not be avoided."

 NW_JAP.126.d.a: "Our Foreign Minister recently handed over new terms on which an agreement could be concluded. They were written under the strong influence of the army top brass. To expect the Americans to agree to them was naive folly, which is exactly what happened - the American Secretary of State said that the negotiation process would not begin until Japan proved that she did not support an aggressive policy."
 NW_JAP.126.d.b: "$NW_JAP.126.d.a$\n\nOur last hope may be a personal meeting between the two leaders of states, which our ambassador in Washington has suggested.

 NW_JAP.127.t: "A Face-To-Face Meeting of the Leaders"
 NW_JAP.127.d: "The Japanese ambassador to Washington is not giving up hope for negotiations. Now his new proposal is a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders of state somewhere in Hawaii. Current Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe is a very controversial personality. He is the only one who is accepted by the army as prime minister, and besides, he is a supporter of rather fascist ideas in the Japanese government, there are many radical politicians in his entourage. But at the same time he is a staunch opponent of war with Western powers, his "political mentor" was the last elder statesman of Japan, Genrō Kimmochi Saionji, an absolutely pro-Western liberal politician who once represented his country at the Paris Peace Conference after the Great War. Konoe's son, however, had himself studied in the United States in the early 1930s and when his father visited he had a private, unofficial meeting with President Roosevelt."

 NW_JAP.128.d: "The American president is ready to go to a personal meeting with Prime Minister Konoe, but to organise it, it is necessary to initially show that Japan is not pursuing an aggressive invasive policy, which is the American demand. Otherwise, a meeting between the leaders would be misunderstood by the public and other countries. Such a gesture could be the withdrawal of troops from Indochina. However, again, to do such a thing, we need to influence the army top brass."

 NW_JAP.128.b: "That seems like an impossible task. I'd rather resign. I guess so."
 NW_JAP.130.t: "The Consent of the Americans"
 NW_JAP.130.d: "The American government has agreed to our ambitious proposal. The meeting will still be held in Alaska, in Juneau, and not, as originally planned, in Hawaii. Konoe must do all this secretly enough that the people who want to eliminate him will not be able to do anything about it. From a conspiracy point of view, Alaska is even better than Hawaii."
 NW_JAP.130.a: "Prince Konoe, please hurry up and get in the car to the airport!!"

However, it became possible after the Japanese and American leaders needed a place where they could meet face-to-face. Preparations for this meeting had already been underway for weeks - almost in secret, as it had opponents in both countries. But this meeting was needed as air to avoid the war that was already on the horizon after the United States imposed a trade embargo on Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, a staunch opponent of war with the U.S., was able to negotiate in a private meeting with the American president a U.S.-brokered peace between China and Japan, as had once happened in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, on the following terms: the US lifts any restrictions on trade with Japan, the US recognises Manchukuo as an independent state, Japan recognises the current Chinese government with the condition that it includes politicians from the pro-Japanese governments in the occupied territories, Japan withdraws all its troops from China. After the conclusion of the conference, journalists were invited to the announcement of the terms of peace, as well as to the solemn part - the mutual handshake of the two leaders, which was an important symbol of the meeting. The American President promised that he would certainly endeavour to visit the Empire of Japan as soon as he had an opportunity to do so."

However, it became possible after the Japanese and American leaders needed a place where they could meet face-to-face. Preparations for this meeting had already been underway for weeks - almost in secret, as it had opponents in both countries. But this meeting was needed as air to avoid the war that was already on the horizon after the United States imposed a trade embargo on Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, a staunch opponent of war with the U.S., was able to negotiate in a private meeting with the American president a U.S.-brokered peace between China and Japan, as had once happened in 1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, on the following terms: the US lifts any restrictions on trade with Japan, Japan completely withdraws its troops from Indochina, which becomes "the Asian analogue of Switzerland", as the American leader formulated this idea. After the conference, journalists were invited to the announcement of the terms of peace, as well as to the solemn part - the mutual handshake of the two leaders, which was an important symbol of the meeting.

 NW_JAP.132.d: "The news of the Alaska conference hit Japan like a thunderclap. Some people began to rejoice with enthusiasm at the conclusion of the Chinese incident and the fact that war with the United States had been avoided and that Japanese financial assets had been unfrozen. Others, predominantly military officers and people with a military stream, began to demonstrate in the streets of Tokyo. The officers themselves do not believe that the entire army, which had been involved in battles with the Chinese, could be quietly withdrawn to Japanese soil. Prince Konoe returned to Haneda Airport, which had been cordoned off beforehand to prevent unnecessary unrest. However, threats are already being made towards the prime minister by the most radical members of the army and politics. After a meeting of the former prime ministers, it was decided that the emperor should make an address to the nation confirming the withdrawal of troops from China."

 NW_JAP.133.t: "An Attempt on the Prince's Life"
 NW_JAP.133.d: "The saddest expectations were confirmed - Prince Konoe was assassinated during his visit to the government buildings in the capital. The identity of the assassin was surprising - it was General Masanobu Tsuji, who attempted to commit the crime with his katana. Konoe's personal driver rushed at Masanobu, who was approaching the prime minister, but was not in time - the distance was too close, and the general acted with lightning speed. Despite the attempt to get the prince to the hospital quickly, he lost consciousness extremely quickly - the katana pierced his stomach through, and the loss of blood was monstrous."

The identity of the assassin was surprising - it was General Masanobu Tsuji, who attempted to commit the crime with his katana. The prince was saved by his driver, who rushed at the general from behind and knocked him to the ground. That Tsuji was able to get so fatally close to the Prime Minister's figure means that he had sympathetic participants in the crime."

 NW_JAP_news.12.d: "The positive headlines of international newspapers reporting how the Japanese prime minister and the American president had managed to reach an understanding at the Alaska conference were instantly replaced by the terrible news of the Prime Minister's assassination. The Japanese "doves of peace" had long claimed that the supporters of war in their country had many forces, and more importantly, radical supporters ready to commit such a heinous act. One of them was General Masanobu Tsuji - with each new act of terrorism, done by the military in Japan, the ranks of the killers grew and grew, and reached such high ranks. The man who saved Asia from a major war could not find a response in his homeland. The President of the United States [USA.GetLeader] has already called it a "crime against peace and Asia" and expressed his condolences to the Japanese people and the Konoe family. Some suggested that this would turn the whole situation around, but no - the emperor himself addressed the nation and supported the Prime Minister's course on the eve of the assassination and what's more the killer-general has already been arrested and is being prepared for trial."

After firing all the bullets, he fled in an unknown direction and has not been found yet. Good luck no one was injured except for the car.

 NW_JAP.138.d: "American President Roosevelt offered, in exchange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Indochina, a treaty between Japan on the one hand and Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States on the other. Under the proposed treaty, Japan would be guaranteed a substantial supply of natural resources. Roosevelt believed that French Indochina could be turned into "Asian Switzerland". Perhaps this is our real chance to right the wrongs and prevent the criminal  war between the countries."

 NW_JAP_news.13.d: "After Japanese troops arbitrarily occupied the entire territory of French Indochina, it seemed to everyone that a harsh reaction from the United States or the colonial powers of the West would immediately follow. However, the leaders of these countries managed to "cool the hotheads" and found a peaceful solution to the conflict. Today between representatives of the Empire of Japan, the United States of America and France an agreement was concluded on the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Indochina in exchange for the restoration of trade relations with Japan, as well as the establishment of an "open door" condition in Indochina itself and declaring it a neutral territory. American President Roosevelt, commenting on the agreement, said that he saw Indochina as the Asian Switzerland."

Despite your position to avoid negotiations in every possible way, we propose to resume the conference". The Manchurian conference between  the representatives of Mongolia and Manchukuo was held in 1935 to establish the border between these states, as the positions of the Soviet and Japanese sides do not coincide on this issue - the maps were too inaccurate. Because of this, over the past few years there have been constant armed clashes on the border between the two countries. In addition, since the MPR and the Manchurian state are both in approximately the same international status, the Japanese representatives insist on discussing the issue of mutual recognition of the two states. We need to give recommendations on further actions for the Mongolian side."

The resolution was almost unanimously supported by the Congressmen. The speech itself was broadcast live on radio, and it drew the largest audience in American history, with more than 81 percent of people listening to the President's address.

The Japanese Prime Minister referred to the military action in East Asia and the Pacific as the 'Great East Asian War'.

The excessive strengthening of the executive's power, even in times of war, could allow some dormant political forces to take advantage of the situation and launch a 'creeping coup d'état'.

 NW_JAP_news.18.d: "After the recent attempted military mutiny in the capital of the Empire of Japan, the country was faced with a big question - what comes next: reform or repression? The most unexpected result of the revolt was that the supposedly assassinated former Prime Minister Keisuke Okada almost turned up at his own funeral, when it turned out that the rebels had killed the wrong man, mistaking him for his own father-in-law, who actually looked like him. He spent those days hiding in the attic of his own house, where he was never found. However, when he appeared before the Emperor, he resigned, feeling that he was responsible for the mutiny and that he had deceived the Emperor by faking his death. His resignation was accepted and Kōki Hirota, a career diplomat who had served as foreign minister in the previous government, was chosen as the new prime minister and began to promote the idea of rapprochement between China and Japan."

Their plans include the creation of a body under the Prime Minister to handle budgetary research and policy, a personnel agency reporting only to the Prime Minister to centralise authority over civil service appointments, the merging of several government ministries, the transfer of posts from one ministry to another, and the expansion of agencies to regulate trade, fuel, electricity and civil aircraft. Their plan also calls for radical reforms of local government, in parallel with the centralisation of the national administration.

It is inexcusable for a constitutional politician to plot behind the scenes. It is shameful and corrupt for politicians to collude with the military outside the political sphere to achieve their own ambitions.\n\nToday's parliamentary session could go down in history, according to the newspapers. Saitō Takao, a prominent critic of militarism and fascism, a liberal and member of the Rikken Minseitō party, gave an hour and a half speech from the Parliament rostrum, beginning with an address to War Minister Hisaichi Terauchi, in which he called on the military to engage in army reform and also asked the cabinet to comment on the national reforms proposed by the War Ministry.\n\nIn the second half of his speech, he addressed the February 26 incident, criticising the young soldiers' action and the military's interference in politics, and suggesting that the senior military's relaxed reaction to the May 15 incident may have been a major cause of the attempted mutiny.\n\nAll the major newspapers in Tokyo ran a front-page headline in capital letters about Saitō Takao's speech, praising it as an unprecedented and historic parliamentary speech. At the end of the parliamentary session, Saitō was surrounded by journalists outside the Parliament building and asked to comment.\n\n- I think that even if I die, this speech will remain for a long time in the constitutional history of our country."

At the centre of these debates is the issue of increased military spending, which the army is trying to lobby for because of the ongoing clashes in northern China and the suppression of guerrilla resistance in Manchuria. Over the past year and a half, various ideologues in top army circles have promoted the threat of a major war in Asia for which the country must prepare.\n\nFinance Minister Eiichi Baba has drawn up a budget with much higher spending on the army than in previous years. In addition, the country simply does not have the money to pay for it without raising taxes. However, a large faction of the military (known as the Manchurian faction) supports the minister. They see this as the basis for building a 'national defence state'."

 NW_JAP.182.d: "After we made concessions to the military in terms of increased spending on the army, there was an unexpected embarrassment in parliament. The oldest member of the House of Representatives from the Rikken Seiyūkai Party, Kunimatsu Hamada, took the floor.\n\n- In recent years, due to special circumstances, freedom of speech has been under pressure and people cannot say what they want to say and are dissatisfied. At the same time, the military is proud of itself... the political ideology of strengthening the dictatorship always comes from the military.\n\nIn general, he criticised military interference in civilian government, recalling recent incidents, especially the attempted coup in early 1936. Army Minister Terauchi then spoke.\n\n- The last words make me feel that I and the military here are despised. Hamada clarified:\n\n- Please give facts about what offended the Army in my words.\n\n- It sounded like an insult, Terauchi interjected.\n\nTerauchi is now demanding that the Prime Minister should dissolve parliament to 'teach a lesson to political parties that lack knowledge of the overall situation in the country'. If Hirota fails to do so, Terauchi will resign and we will have to form a new government."

Genrō Saionji Kinmonchi proposed the candidacy of General Kazushige Ugaki, the current governor of Korea. He is a man of liberal outlook who tried to implement his reforms to modernise and downsize the army in the early 30s, but is persona non grata among other military officers for that very reason. On the other hand, his time as Army Minister has given him time to build his own faction of the military around him, which will help him to subordinate the military to the civilian government."

 NW_JAP.184.d: "As expected, the military were unhappy with the prime ministerial candidate, General Ugaki Kazushige, and are now sabotaging the formation of the government by refusing to nominate a person for the post of Army Minister. The last time they did this was in 1913, during the constitutional crisis that followed Emperor Taishō's accession to the throne, after which they were constitutionally barred from doing so. However, the previous Prime Minister, Kōki Hirota, gave them back that opportunity in an attempt to secure their loyalty.\n\nUgaki has the option of overriding the military's veto by returning to active military service, thus assuming the position of Minister of the Army and Prime Minister at the same time. However, he would need the approval of the Imperial Court."

 NW_JAP.185.t: "Ugaki's Cabinet Fall"
 NW_JAP.185.d: "General Ugaki was never able to form his cabinet because the military blocked any nomination for the post of Army Minister through the active military officer system. This has caused a major blow to the morale of much of the political elite, confirming the military's growing influence over the formation of civilian government. Ugaki himself is in a depressed state, having essentially failed to carry out the Emperor's order to form a government.\n\nColonel Ishiwara, the leader of the Manchurian military faction, is believed to have been involved in this plot. He persuaded even those close to Ugaki to refuse to appoint an Army Minister and prevented Ugaki from contacting the Imperial Court for consultations.\n\nThe elderly Genrō Saionji was deeply affected by these events. He would not advise the Emperor on candidacy of a new Prime Minister, so General Hayashi was recommended by other politicians close to the Emperor."

He is a well-known figure in Japanese politics, having been the Minister of War in the late 1920s, when he attempted to modernise the army by cutting its budget, much to the discontent of many officers. However, he managed to build up a sufficient faction of supporters. A series of unfortunate scandals in the early 1930s, including an attempt to take part in a failed coup d'état, cost him his position and influence. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of peace with the Western powers and the preservation of the previous political regime.

After this proposal, the Diet exploded with a thousand arguments and discussions. Hirota managed to bring the supporters and opponents of the idea together, thus avoiding unnecessary problems. The Diet was roughly evenly divided, although one might have expected the idea to be universally rejected in the Diet. However, almost all the smaller parties, as well as Tōhōkai and part of Shakai Taishūtō, supported the idea. Many members of the Rikken Seiyūkai were also in favour.\n\nNow the Prime Minister has to decide what to do next. The attempt to ‘test the reaction’ to the one-party state has gone too far and requires him not to retract his words.

Hirota managed to bring the supporters and opponents of the idea together, thus avoiding unnecessary problems.

 NW_JAP.195.d: "A series of assassinations of senior politicians and businessmen in early 1932, culminating in the murder of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on 15 May, revealed the existence of a secret ultra-nationalist sect led by the self-styled Buddhist preacher Nisshō Inoue. After a number of mystical experiences in 1923-24, he came to believe that Japan needed a spiritual revival and that he was called to be its saviour. He founded a school in Ibaraki Prefecture to promote agrarianism and social reform, which gradually became a training centre for right-wing radicals. He devised the slogan 'ichinin issatsu' ('one person, one kill') and drew up a list of twenty politicians and business leaders whose assassination would be the first step toward restoring supreme political power to the Emperor, a platform known as the 'Shōwa Restoration'.\n\nAt this time, with the help of Mitsuaki Tanaka, former Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan, he met right-wing figures such as Shūmei Ōkawa and Ikki Kita, and received enthusiastic support from radical young officers at the nearby Tsuchiura naval base. In 1930 Inoue moved to Tokyo, where he set about building the Ketsumeidan organisation by recruiting members among radical university students. The group was officially founded in 1932 with 13 young officers, with the aim of overthrowing the political and economic elite of the time. The group's first wave of assassinations came in early 1932, when former finance minister Junnosuke Inoue was shot dead on 9 February and Baron Dan Takuma, director-general of the Mitsui zaibatsu, was shot dead on 5 March in what made headlines under the general title 'League of Blood Incident'."

Many members of the Japanese public began to sympathise with the conspirators' aims, if not their methods. After this incident, the defendants began to use the defence line of acting in the interests of the Emperor. Abbot Rinzai Gempō Yamamoto testified in favour of his former disciple, justifying his violence from a Zen and imperialist point of view. In November 1934, Inoue and three Ketsumeidan militants were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe 11 assassins of the Prime Minister were tried by court-martial, but before sentencing the court received a petition signed in blood by 350,000 people throughout Japan in solidarity with the defendants' views and loyalty to the Emperor; later the court received a letter from 11 young men from Niigata who wished to be executed instead of the officers, the envelope containing seven fingers cut off as a sign of the seriousness of their intentions. As a result, they received much lighter sentences, despite the seriousness of their crime."

 NW_JAP.197.d: "Nissho Inoue was the only one who dared to realise the ideology of Nichirenism, a nationalistic interpretation of the Nichiren doctrine that originated in Japan in the 13th century. Its main populariser was Tanaka Chigaku, a famous orator, writer and propagandist. In 1908 he moved to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, where in 1911 he wrote his most famous work, The Doctrine of Saint Nitiren, which presents the radical 13th-century priest Nitiren as the protector of the Japanese nation and calls for the unification of the world through Nitirenism, with the emperor as its nucleus. 'The very purpose of Japan's existence,' he wrote, 'is to realise this plan as a country designed to build Nitiren Buddhism'. In 1914 Tanaka united all his followers into a single organisation, the Kokuchūkai, based in Miho. As he grew older, he became increasingly convinced that Japan's seizure of Manchuria in 1931 was ordained by God and part of a divine plan to spread 'true' Nitiren Buddhism throughout Asia.\n\nKanji Ishiwara joined his followers, such as Nissho Inoue, after his trip to Germany in the 1920s. Partly based on these ideas, Ishiwara formulated his own concept of the 'Last War'. In addition, the notorious ideologue Ikki Kita had close links with Tanaka and his organisation. And now in a position of power, the followers of Nichirenism asked Ishiwara to pardon the conspirators of 1932, led by Nissho Inoue, who were serving life sentences."

It has recently been given a new tool to put pressure on the government - the ability to influence the formation and approval of the cabinet by reinstating the rule that only serving officers can become army ministers. This rule was abolished in 1913 after the country's constitutional crisis. Its return immediately led to a new crisis - the Emperor initially entrusted the formation of a new government to General Ugaki, an influential member of the old generation of the military, whom it was hoped would take control. He was never able to form a cabinet, however, as none of the serving officers agreed to take up the post of war minister. The Japanese people were shocked. Such direct military involvement in civilian government was out of line. General Ugaki was forced to resign in defiance of the Emperor's decree.

 NW_JAP.206.d: "The dominant Manchurian faction of the military sent General Hayashi a list of men for positions in the new cabinet. Seishirō Itagaki was to be Minister of War; Suetsugu Nobumasa, an admiral with radical reformist leanings, was chosen as Minister of the Navy; either Yōsuke Matsuoka or Toshio Shiratori was acceptable as Minister of Foreign Affairs; industrialist Seihin Ikeda was their choice to head the Ministry of Finance; Shingo Tsuda, Minister of Trade and Industry; Shinji Sogō, Chief Cabinet Secretary; and Masayoshi Miyazaki, Chairman of the Future Cabinet Planning Council.\n\nAs can be seen from the personalities, almost all of them are close associates of the influential Colonel Kanji Ishiwara, who has been trying for months to push through his plan to reform the political system under the name of the 'National Defence State'. Despite his popularity, Ishiwara is so intent on maintaining his status as a grey eminence that he has refused to accept any ministerial posts.\n\nThe appointment of such a cabinet means that Hayashi will have to submit almost completely to the influence of the Manchurian faction, but does the old general have a choice?"

Upon hearing this, Shinji Sogō, who had hoped to become the official organiser of the 'Manchurian Cabinet', tried unsuccessfully to prevent Hayashi from meeting with the emissaries of Umezu's group. In the end, Hayashi rejected most of the names put forward by the Manchurian faction, and instead of Itagaki and Suetsugu he chose Ketare Nakamura and Mitsumasa Yonai, who had been chosen by the top brass of the army and navy. Kanji Ishiwara has been understandably upset.\n\nSogō, furious with Hayashi, demanded that Hayashi immediately refuse the emperor's request to form a government, and Ishiwara himself, accompanied by Asahara, is said to have urged the old general to protest against the composition of his cabinet. But Hayashi stood firm. Disgusted, the leaders of the Manchurian faction met and decided to have nothing more to do with supporting Hayashi's government. The attempt to form a 'Manchurian Cabinet' failed, and with it the Manchurian faction and much of Ishiwara's influence."

 NW_JAP.208.d: "General Hayashi, as Prime Minister and already an unpopular figure, began to promote ideas that eventually undermined parliamentary confidence in his candidacy. He passed a law to raise taxes to fund the army and cut subsidies to entrepreneurs. But this was only the beginning of his ambitious plans. As a member of the Tōseiha faction, which had won in the army, he wanted to start implementing the plans of this group of military men, which were to reduce the power of parliament, finally suppress democracy in the country and move towards a totalitarian system as inevitable for the sake of the victory of the Empire of Japan in the coming war."

General Hayashi's attempt at political reform has caused him to lose support in the Diet. In addition, the political climate in the world is becoming more tense, as wars are once again becoming a tool of diplomacy rather than negotiation. In this situation, the country needs a national leader who can unite all segments of society and lead it through the thorns to greatness. Only the young Prince Fumimaro Konoe, who has been trained for such a position all his life by the elderly genrō Saionji Kinmochi, can become such a person."

 NW_JAP.211.d: "The Shōwakai Party was founded in December 1935 by a group of 18 Diet members who had left the Rikken Seiyūkai Party after its leaders decided not to support Admiral Okada's cabinet. This was followed by several expulsions from the party for collaborating with the old party, and a fairly successful electoral performance for the new party - it won 20 seats in 1936. In the last election the number was reduced to 19. This uncertainty among voters, as well as the apparent meaninglessness of this party's independence after the change of government, led the leaders of the Shōwakai to announce today that they would reunite with the Rikken Seiyūkai."
 NW_JAP.211.a: "It seems the whole parliament is losing power, not just Shōwakai"
 NW_JAP.212.t: "Breakfast Society"
 NW_JAP.212.d: "In October 1930, the Shōwa Kenkyūkai (Shōwa Research Association), a political think tank, was established as an informal organisation to study and evaluate issues related to the Meiji Constitution and current political problems. Its leader, Ryūnosuke Gotō, is a close friend and associate of Prime Minister Konoe, which is why some refer to the Shōwa Kenkyūkai as Konoe's think tank.\n\nThe membership of the Shōwa Kenkyūkai was deliberately diverse to avoid political bias. It included a wide range of scholars, journalists, bankers, businessmen and military officers. The exceptions were politicians and bureaucrats. As a result, the group was heavily skewed towards leftists and Marxists. For the same reason, in the course of their work they came to believe that liberal democracy was outdated, that parliament should be replaced by a corporate assembly, and that the economy should be built on more command and control principles.\n\nAlso today, on the initiative of the personal secretaries of Prime Minister Tomohiko Ushiba and Michizo Kishi, a small think-tank is being formed under the unofficial name of "Asameshikai" ("Breakfast Society"). The idea was to meet twice a month for breakfast at around eight o'clock in the morning. Over a meal, the members of the society would be free to discuss many confidential matters in the interest of Konoe. The Breakfast Society is an ideal place for a confidential and frank exchange of views on domestic and international matters. It should be stressed, however, that even the meetings of such high-ranking officials did not escape the increased scrutiny of the intelligence services, especially because of the critical number of leftists among them."

 NW_JAP.213.t: "Genrō's Retirement"
 NW_JAP.213.d: "The last genrō, Saionji Kinmochi, can finally retire - his apprentice, Fumimaro Konoe, has become prime minister. After years of rule and covert influence, the old politician has found someone he can trust to lead the country. Although Kimmochi and Konoe's political views have diverged in recent years, the genrō believes he has taught his mentee to make the right decisions for the nation in the current global situation.\n\nThus, one of the oldest institutions of power in the post-Meiji Empire, the genrōs, who until the last days determined the vector of the country's domestic policy by advising the emperor on whom to appoint as prime minister, will cease to function. It remains to be seen whether Hirohito is ready to take on such a responsibility, or whether he will continue to consult his inner circle on such an important issue."

 NW_JAP_news.23.d: "Following Japan's general election, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, from a long line of the imperial family, became the new prime minister. Following the example of the Hayashi government, the Konoe cabinet adopted a moderate tone in foreign policy. The government took the position that the implementation of a new programme of economic and military preparedness would be best achieved by avoiding premature conflicts with either the Anglo-American powers or the Chinese nationalist movement. Konoe was equally peace-loving in his domestic policies. To placate reformist sympathisers, he invited Eiichi Baba back into the government as Minister of the Interior, but to appease business interests he gave key posts in the Ministries of Finance and Trade to career bureaucrats Okinori Kaya and Shinji Yoshino."

 NW_JAP.214.t: "Tekigai-sō"
 NW_JAP.214.d: "The main residence of the Fumimaro Konoe family is an apartment in the Mejiro district of central Tokyo, but a few months before becoming prime minister, Konoe purchased a villa in the Ogikubo district of Suginami, a rural suburb of Tokyo. The villa had previously belonged to Irisawa Tatsukichi, chief physician of the Ministry of the Imperial Court during the Taishō period and head of the Faculty of Medicine at Tokyo Imperial University. It was built by the famous architect of the Meiji era, Itō Chūta. It features high ceilings as Irisawa promoted a western lifestyle, and an important change for him was the ability to sit at a high table on chairs rather than on the floor as was traditional in Japanese homes. There are also some exotic design details in the interior, reflecting Itō's travels to China, India and the Middle East.\n\nAfter buying it, Konoe redesigned the interior in a more Japanese style and added a kura, a traditional building used for storage. The villa is surrounded by 6,000 square metres of gardens. Konoe's chief preceptor, genrō Saionji Kinmochi, was invited to be the first guest in the new house. He slowly walked around the estate, looked at the gardens and named it Tekigai-sō. The Prince had originally intended to use it as a summer residence, but he liked the views and the rural tranquillity so much that he began to spend most of his time here. He even held his first press conference with journalists here in Ogikubo after his appointment as Prime Minister."

All socialists have tried to dissociate themselves from communism in order not to be associated with this movement.\n\nOn the other hand, those who know Konoe well might have expected something like this, as his circle of close friends has always included a few Communists or former Communist Party members or sympathisers."

A large costume party was held at her father's residence, to which many of the genrō's friends were invited. His loyal pupil Fumimaro Konoe could not stay away, especially as he was the same age as his daughter and they were also good friends.\n\nWhen most of the guests had gathered at Saionji's house, a black car pulled up. Its side door opened and, crouching down, stepped out... Adolf Hitler. Or rather, Fumimaro Konoe, who had dressed up as Hitler and even made his fringes look like the famous ones of the German Fuehrer (he has been trimming his moustache the same way for a long time). This was no longer news to the 90-year-old liberal Saionji. He had long realised that his 'heir''s political views differed from his own."

Today, representatives of the movement met with him at his Tokyo apartment. They floated the idea to the Prime Minister of putting pressure on the main political parties in Parliament by organising mass demonstrations of the movement's supporters outside their headquarters or the Diet building itself. Their demand would be for the parties to dissolve themselves. Konoe listened attentively, then got up from his chair, lit a cigarette and stared out of the window.\n\n'On the one hand, it's in my interest' - thought the Prime Minister - 'on the other, it's another political destabilisation...'.\n\n- If we act without fear, then... - he broke the silence of his interlocutor, - this story could develop into... - he stammered.

They made a lot of noise and began to disturb the people around them. After they unfurled their placards and started the rally, it became clear that they were activists of the One Party Movement.

 NW_JAP.219.d: "Tensions on the streets of Tokyo near the headquarters of Rikken Seiyūkai and Rikken Minseitō came to a head this evening when militants from both bases marched in columns straight to the doors of the party offices. They managed to disarm the Rikken Seiyūkai guards and occupied the party building, taking the people inside hostage. The Rikken Minseitō representatives were more fortunate, as the militants failed to break into their building, but were blocked by them inside. The militants are demanding that the party's members declare self-dissolution in support of the One Party Movement, arguing that the party's outdated ideological stance will only relegate it to the pages of history and that it should not interfere with the country's development.\n\nThe telephones at the Metropolitan Police Station have been ringing off the hook all day with persistent calls from the seized party offices. Indifferent onlookers have gathered outside the police, Parliament and party offices to watch the latest incident unfold. It is worth noting that the militants are unarmed, but either the police must finally do something or other political actors must take action, which is what the supporters of the One Party Movement are most likely waiting for."

He took full responsibility for what had happened. There is a remarkable silence in the newspapers - either everyone is in a wild state of confusion, or they do not want to risk the dissolution of the Government if the consequences of the incident are exaggerated, or they are lost in speculation as to what secret and invisible political struggle has been going on all this time that has led to such an incident, remotely reminiscent of some of the events of recent years perpetrated by military radicals. But everyone seems reluctant to draw such parallels."

He is constantly mentioned in the newspapers in the event of another political article, and when he is seen on the streets, he is always in a hurry, almost running, with a pile of papers under his arm. He is also a close friend of Prime Minister Konoe and Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kōichi Kido, all three of whom are young aristocrats.\n\nToday's incident proves this intimacy between Konoe and Harada: Harada paid a surprise visit to the Prime Minister's residence late at night on important business, only to be warned that the Prince had already gone to bed. So he went straight to the bedroom and discovered that Konoe was actually sleeping with Harada's wife. Harada, who had often complained to Konoe about his bad relations with women, kicked his wife out of the bedroom and lay down on the futon with Konoe, having secret talks until morning."

It is worth noting their fundamentally different views on the country's foreign policy - Konoe still wants to find a settlement with Britain and the U.S., and Matsuoka nurtures ideas about a Eurasian alliance of Japan, Germany and the USSR, which he will be able to realize in the highest position. However, Konoe's influence is far greater than that of Matsuoka, who is also a well-known political figure and has connections, but cannot compare with the prince - his authority is unyielding even in front of the military."

Among the most important of these are political reform to strengthen the powers of the executive branch and economic reform to build a more state-run economy in a modern manner. In addition, since Matsuoka is known to the world primarily as a diplomat, he also has foreign policy ambitions - building a new global alliance system based on checks and balances."

In essence, they're proposing a return to the points of agreement drawn up by German Ambassador Trautmann. That is:\n1. The autonomy of Inner Mongolia;\n2. Demilitarized Zone between Manchukuo and northern China under the government of Nanjing;\n3. Demilitarized Zone in Shanghai with international police;\n4.

For him, however, his main goal was to restore democratic cabinets made up of members of parliament. As it seemed to him, at the moment, he was ready for that. But the talks held today with the genro and the Emperor's advisers had made him change this opinion. Moreover, he has now been persuaded to continue to lead the “national unity cabinet” (now called the “navy cabinet” by some because of the reforms the former admiral is implementing) in order to keep the country stable."

At the moment, this is the Rikken Minsaito Party, which managed to defeat the Rikken Seiyukai in the February 20, 1936 election with a vigorous election campaign using new and relevant slogans among the voters. However, perhaps we should hold new Seimas elections against the backdrop of the changes that have taken place so that the first party cabinet after a long break will have more legitimacy in the eyes of the voters."

Now, however, he has finally accomplished all his plans, and has also managed to restore a stable political system that suits the elites, even though it has not returned to the state of Taize democracy. Okada is already too old - both himself and the politicians around him recognize this.

In addition, the discord in the camp of the two main parliamentary parties played a role - all this together gave the new party a chance to come to power, which it took advantage of. For a while, the question of who would form the cabinet hung in the air, as at the moment Kakushin Shintō retained a system of collective leadership of two presidents - Abe Isu or Seigō Nakano, but it quickly became known that the latter would become prime minister, as it is his ideology that the whole party adheres to at the moment."

Moreover, it even includes the idea of returning to democracy after a certain period of dictatorship, obtained in a “constitutional” way through the parliament.

The National Socialists, on the other hand, believe that trade unions, on the contrary, solve only the very difficulties of the working class, but do not eliminate the problem itself. In addition, they divide workers into two kinds: those who have joined a trade union and everyone else.\n\n\nThe National Socialist faction's decision not only to withdraw support from the unions, but also to launch a state struggle against them, could not but cause an explosion of discontent both among the unions themselves and within Shakai Taishūtō.

However, the further Shakai Taishūtō's National Socialists drifted to the right on the political compass, the more they came to resemble those they opposed.

Some analysts are already making loud claims that with this appointment Japan is finally on the path to war. In addition, Tojo is the first prime minister in a long time who decided to combine at once ministerial posts from his own cabinet on himself. And what is more, he did not leave the active army, which is also a violation of the traditions of Japanese politics."

He was known in Europe in the 20s for his extravagant behavior for a member of the monarchical house, but with the onset of the Great Depression he returned to Japan, joined the army and headed one of the units on the islands. He gradually became involved in politics in the 1930s, but he became actively involved in politics when the radical military, which was trying to start a war, became extremely influential. His arrival as Prime Minister means a great risk for the Chrysanthemum Throne, as now the Imperial dynasty is directly involved in political issues, and all responsibility for the future rests on the Prince's shoulders.

The situation is complicated by the fact that despite the evacuations in the city remain representatives of European countries in the so-called “Nanjing Security Zone”, created by German businessman Jon Rabe. He and American missionary Luis Smythe are recording everything that is happening and have already filed complaints with our embassy. Journalists, including Japanese journalists and those officially allowed into the war zone by the army leadership, are adding fuel to the fire. For example, the case, which was covered by two Japanese newspapers, when two officers on the approach to Nanjing competed to be the first to slaughter 100 people with a sword - and their competition continued after this mark was reached, has already become widely known. If this massacre was not stopped, the morale of the troops would finally collapse and Japan would be irreparably damaged internationally. Since two members of the Imperial Family, Prince Kotohito and Prince Yasuhiko, are responsible for the capture of Nanking, the press may leak information about it, which would further damage the reputation of the Imperial Family."

 NW_JAP.288.d: "Today, the worst thing imaginable at the moment had happened - one of the crazed junior officers from the army had made an assassination attempt on Admiral Yamamoto after all. Despite the so-called 'guards' assigned to him by the senior army officers, the admiral's safety was not properly ensured. Somehow, a land officer who had absolutely nothing to do with the local naval base managed to infiltrate it with a cold weapon and deliver a sneak attack, from which Yamamoto died almost on the spot. The news of this was a heavy blow to all who knew the admiral well. During an urgently convened government conference attended by the army minister, he was reprimanded by the emperor - an incredible gesture from the usually calm and composed monarch:\n\n- This is not just a blow to the Imperial Navy, it is a blow to the Imperial family and the emperor himself! It is likely that such harshness is due to Yamamoto's well-known closeness to the reigning monarch. It is expected that a solemn state funeral will be organized in the near future."
 NW_JAP.288.a: "This is a major blow to the entire country"
 NW_JAP.289.t: "Yamamoto Threats"
 NW_JAP.289.d: "The hatred of army officers for their naval counterparts continues to grow. Admiral Yamamoto is receiving an endless stream of hate mail from his opponents, as well as direct threats from Japanese nationalists, but he is very calm about the possibility of an attempt on his life. In an interview with reporters, he said:\n\n\n- To die for the Emperor and the Motherland is the highest honor for a military man. Flowers rise in the field where a hard, brave battle was fought. And even under the threat of death, a fighting man will be eternally loyal to the emperor and his land. The life and death of one man means nothing. The empire comes first. As Confucius said, “You can crush cinnabar, but you can't take away its color; you can burn flowers, but you can't destroy their scent.” They can destroy my body, but they can never subdue my will.\n\n\n\n0 Recently, senior army officers ordered the military police to “guard” the admiral. Many speculate that in reality, this is an attempt to 'keep him under control' because of his unwavering stance on the alliance with Germany.”"

 NW_JAP.290.t: "The Conflict Between the Navy and the Army"
 NW_JAP.290.d: "During the past year a large number of army and navy officers have begun to speak out publicly against certain Japanese admirals. Isoroku Yamamoto, Mitsumasa Yonai, and Shigeyoshi Inoue have been particularly criticized because of their strong disapproval of a possible alliance with Germany and because of their opposition to plans to seize the “southern resource zone.” For example, Admiral Yamamoto Yamamoto did not personally support the invasion of Manchuria in 1931.\n/p Politically, he was in favor of a peaceful solution to all conflicts. He was strongly opposed to war with the United States, a position that came out of his training at Harvard, his service as an assistant admiral, and his service as naval attaché (twice) in Washington. He attended the second London Naval Conference in 1930 with the rank of Rear Admiral, and already with the rank of Vice Admiral at the London Naval Conference of 1934. The Japanese government believed that the cadre military specialist must accompany diplomats during the discussion of arms reduction.\n\n \n\nThe popularity of Yamamoto in the navy is incredibly high - he is loved by ordinary sailors and officers, as he has always treated them with deep respect. In addition, Admiral Yamamoto and Admiral Yonai have close ties to the Imperial Family, which further enhances their influence."

 NW_JAP.291.d: "Sayonji Kimmochi, who once considered Konoe as his protégé in resolving the political conflict, has left this world. Perhaps this explains the radical nature of the proposals that Prince Konoe has made. There was now no genro representative left to advise the emperor on the appointment of a prime minister during such a difficult period. Instead, the new Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Kōichi Kido, canvassed the opinions of all former prime ministers as high-ranking statesmen (the so-called jushichi).\n\n\n\nThey quickly agreed that the army's position left no room for the appointment of anyone other than Prince Konoe. Before formally accepting the post of prime minister, Konoe held an extensive round of political discussions at his residence with the men who would occupy key positions in his cabinet: Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, Navy Minister Yoshida Zengo, and Army Minister Hideki Tojo.\n/pThese talks were designed to maximize Konoe's influence over his cabinet. They were held under the veiled threat that Konoe would reject the emperor's offer to lead the government if his key ministers were unwilling to support his political views. Satisfied that this maneuver led to agreement, Konoe quickly formed his cabinet."
 NW_JAP.291.a: "Sly move"
 NW_JAP.292.t: "Konoe's Idea"
 NW_JAP.292.d: "More often than not, during Breakfast Society meetings, if Prince Konoe was present, he was usually silent, as if parodying the Emperor's behavior at Government Ministerial Conferences. Today's meeting, however, went drastically out of the ordinary. Konoe was suddenly the first to break the silence after the meeting began, beginning to speak of his views on the upcoming changes in the country's political structure. The prince argued that the institutional weakness of the premiership limited the prime minister's ability to control the political activities of the military. The political settlement during the Meiji period had deprived the cabinet of leverage in choosing between the priorities of the army and navy or in reconciling the military's views on national policy with those of other elite groups.\n\n\n To cope with these problems, Konoe proposed the establishment of a new political order in Japan. The cornerstone of the new system was to be a new political party that would unite all existing groups in the lower house, but would be led by himself as president. By holding the posts of party leader and prime minister simultaneously, Konoe believed he could strengthen the prime minister's position of control over the people, the lower house, the bureaucracy, and the military. Based on mass organization, the new party would provide channels for mobilizing people in the service of cabinet policies. The political leverage that the prime minister could gain through the support of the new party would strengthen his bargaining position with both the bureaucracy and the military."
 NW_JAP.292.a: "Finally waited... The prince realized what was expected of him"
 NW_JAP.293.t: "On Muted Tones"
 NW_JAP.293.d: "When Konoe finished his detailed plan of action in the event that he became prime minister, the people present were afraid to even speak for fear of scaring away the prince's fighting spirit that everyone had been waiting for. The prolonged silence was interrupted again by Konoe himself:\n\n\n- My plans will require a fundamental.... ahem. reinterpretation of the Meiji Constitution, which was designed specifically to ensure that power is distributed among several elite groups, rather than concentrated in the hands of a single individual or political party. - he spoke in a muffled voice, as if embarrassed by each successive word."

Baseball is a game that came to Japan from the United States, but has become a favorite of many urban dwellers in recent times. Previously, there were individual games between national teams, but now everything is organized at the national and official level with financial support from outside.\n\n\n\nThe radical military from the Kōdōha faction and some Japanese politicians are in favor of banning this sport as a “Western”, but it has a large number of supporters among very different influential politicians and businessmen. For example, Arima Yoriyasu, a close friend of Prince Konoe, a reformer, created his own team, the Tokyo Senators, similar to the American Washingtone Senators. Arima is also a major lobbyist and advocate in political circles.\n\n\nThe current season will be played by 7 teams: 3 from Tokyo, 2 from Osaka, 2 from Nagoya. It is also worth noting the international nature of the Japanese League - several teams are played by Americans, including blacks who could not find a decent place in their homeland because of the policy of segregation, and even one Russian immigrant - Victor Starfin."

 NW_JAP.299.d: "“Fertility hell” became a well-known phrase during the Great Shōwa Depression. The term, literally meaning the painful life caused by having many children, suggests the common perception of having many children as a symbol of an unhappy life. In reality, however, fertility was seen as a pressing issue among the lower class, who suffered from poverty and unemployment. Newspapers began to mention infanticide in both urban and rural areas. To cope with this population growth, the proletarian movement spread the idea of birth control or helping workers and the poor to solve this problem. Since 1934, representatives of the leftist movement have opened Birth Control Advisory Centers in major cities. They are headed by a feminist, Katō Shizue, who, after studying in the West, has absorbed a lot of left-liberal ideas. She argues that the problem of Japan's growing population can be solved by women. She believes that giving women control over their own reproduction will allow women to achieve greater independence and also allow for a society in which women take the lead. Another part of her argument is that birth control will help the people of Japan raise better children. She thinks that by having fewer children, women will be able to create better educational and economic opportunities for their children. In keeping with the “influence and respectability of eugenics,” Katō Shizue also supports eugenics, believing that children born to two healthy parents will be better off than children born to sick or weak parents. Such ideas may become too popular in society and lead us eventually to population decline, and thus inevitable defeat in competition with other, more numerous nations such as the Chinese, Russians or Americans. Now, due to the outbreak of hostilities, we have an official reason to isolate Katō from public life and close her Counseling Center."

 NW_JAP.300.d: "The Meiji Constitution contains no legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing the prime minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the “general ruler of the government,” was to exercise the right of appointment at will, unconstrained by legal provisions or the wishes of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, the issue was resolved when the emperor's nine unofficial advisors, the genro, advised him on whom to appoint as head of the cabinet, and the monarch “agreed” with their candidacy.By the end of the Taisho period, only the great Kimmochi Saionji was still alive.From this period onward, the emperors raised the question of a new procedure for appointing the prime minister.Now the time has come for the urgent need to choose one. Among the options being considered by various members of the emperor's inner circle are the following:\n\n- Consultation with the Privy Council;\n- Consultation with senior ministers.\n\n\n\n/n/n The first involves strengthening the powers of the Privy Council, the emperor's institutional law-making body that advises him on various matters of state.

Today this book has been published and will be printed in large quantities for everyone. Naturally, in it all the laurels of Seiyūkai's victory in the parliamentary elections will go to Nakajima and his entourage, and the other factions will remain in oblivion."

 NW_JAP.303.t: "Kōdōha's Nightmare"
 NW_JAP.303.d: "The military of the Kōdōha faction, as well as the sympathetic Young Officers of the Kokutai Henry-ha faction, and many other political forces, have long tried to portray Japan's political system as a zaibatsu oligarchy combined with a soulless group of military officers and bureaucrats who want not reform but maximum cooperation. At the time of the active confrontation between Tōseiha and Kōdōha, the country was still a blank slate on which anyone could write, draw, or implement a new system. And in the end, in a completely unexpected way, through the strengthening of the democratic government, the country turned into the very oligarchy firmly connected to the military of the Tōseiha faction. The ambitious leader of the Seiyūkai Party, Chikuhei Nakajima, had succeeded in realizing his ideas, and in doing so, he had become a caricatured parody of the Zaibatsu of the Communist propaganda poster: a man with money who was able to effectively subjugate the government."

 NW_JAP_news.50.d: "The Japanese Empire has held parliamentary elections, which resulted in a victory for the opposition Rikken Seiyūkai Party. Its leader is a longtime political schemer and member of parliament Ichiro Hatoyama - lately the party has fallen on hard times, but in the end he managed to hold on to his post as head of the Seiyūkai and lead it to victory, which undoubtedly further strengthens his authority.

Now the leader of this coalition, Hisashi Asō will have to form a government. Some newspapers have already dubbed this Japan's “first socialist government” because of the views of Hisashi himself and his entourage.

Now, however, there is talk in parliament of the need to continue the constitutional movement, and perhaps even to enshrine the supremacy of the civilian government over the military - an absolute taboo in previous years, the violation of which some politicians have had to pay with their lives.

 NW_JAP.306.t: "The Debate Around the New System"
 NW_JAP.306.desc: " NW_JAP.306.desc: “The Meiji Constitution contains no legal provisions concerning the procedure for appointing the prime minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the “general ruler of the government,” was to exercise the right of appointment at will, unconstrained by legal provisions or the wishes of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved - the emperor's nine unofficial advisors, the genro, advise him on who to appoint as head of the cabinet, and the monarch “agrees” to their nomination. However, such a decision could not be permanent because of the natural aging and death of the advisors. Already by the end of the Taisho period, only the great Kimmochi Saionji was left alive. From this period onward, the emperors raised the question of a new procedure for appointing the prime minister. An important, symbolic point of the Shōwa Restoration may be this very reform - a change in the system of appointing the prime minister. The following may be taken as possible options:"
 NW_JAP.306.a: "Recommendation of the Minister of the Interior"

 NW_JAP.307.d: "The East Asian League, or East Asian League, was founded in Tokyo today. Its secretary was Kimura Takeo, a member of the House of Representatives at the instigation of the irrepressible Kanji Ishiwara. Key members of the movement included the latter's Manchu allies, such as Masayoshi Miyazaki, who were disillusioned with what they saw as a rejection of ideals and a slide toward colonialism; former military leaders; and a number of scholars. Kimura also drew into the movement a number of members of Nakano Seigō's right-wing Tōhōkai, who disagreed with the latter's insistence on expanding the war in China and Southeast Asia, as well as farmer's union activists from Northeast Japan and several politicians."
 NW_JAP.307.a: "Another Ishiwara project again...."
 NW_JAP.308.t: "A Critique of the War in China"
 NW_JAP.308.d: "In Ishiwara's own words, “The East Asian League will be based on three principles: political independence, economic integration, and common defense.”  All of this will be in anticipation of the coming 'last war.'” While these goals sound close to some of the goals of the Japanese government, it is also worth considering that Ishiwara's new organization is one of the few opposition voices to the war in China, which has caused it to be heavily criticized by right-wing groups. If the war continues to drag on and we don't counter these East Asian League attacks, we will lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

 NW_JAP.309.d: "The East Asian League continues its political expansion. Besides beginning to print their own magazine, Tōarenmei, in which they promote their ideals, they have begun to open branches of their organization in the occupied territories of China. For example, today a branch of the China-East Asia League opened in Beijing, for which even Ishiwara himself arrived there."

Moreover, they are also expanding their network in China, with the Guangzhou branch of the China-East Asia League and then the Association of Chinese Comrades in Nanjing. In Beijing, Ishiwara succeeded in getting one of the members of the Kuomintang, Miao Bin, on his side."

Some of the MPs reacted positively to this proposal by volunteering for such a mission, but the other, vociferous part of the parliament, on the contrary, remembered their old enemies from the East Asian League and began to fiercely criticize Kimura. The reaction to this was also a proposal by the War Ministry to officially condemn the East Asian League by the government."

 NW_JAP.313.t: "Ishiwara Takes Charge"
 NW_JAP.313.d: "Today Ishiwara Kanji took direct intellectual leadership of the East Asian League and emphasized that the movement had failed in the Seim and should henceforth be seen “not as a political movement but as a true cultural, moral and ‘semi-religious movement’” that should serve as a force that the nation could use “to end the war in China and form an East Asian bloc.” And in society, “to become a motivating factor and a force for organizing people.” Ishiwara also introduced the movement as an “anti-war movement.”\n\n\n/n/n He also introduced a number of reforms in the movement, such as a mandatory membership fee (1 yen and 20 sen per year), which Ishiwara believed, despite the risk of alienating poorer farmers, would raise the level of determination and consciousness of members. The second major reform was the establishment of branches “adapted to local conditions and not limited to one branch in each prefecture.” This meant that local branches would have considerable autonomy and would be able to reflect local issues and culture. It was a measure that was to prove very important and stimulating, particularly for its largest branch in the Shōnai region, which includes the western part of Yamagata Prefecture, which is culturally and linguistically different from the eastern part and separated from it by high mountains."

 NW_JAP.314.d: "With the East Asian League movement gaining popularity, the current government, which has failed to meet its objectives and is in crisis for this reason, will be dissolved at the will of the head of the cabinet because it can no longer fulfill its mandate. The war in China has dragged on, the population is tired of it, and it's time to make peace - all this is confirmed by the growing popularity of the ideas of the irrepressible Kanji Ishiwara. The meeting of the emperor's advisers decided to entrust the formation of the cabinet to his supporters, but there are divided opinions about the candidacy of the prime minister - some believe that it should be Ishiwara himself, while others emphasize the need to let the parliamentary leader of the East Asian League - Kimura Takeo - prove himself. The main disconcerting thing about his candidacy is his age, as he would be the youngest cabinet chief in the country's history."

After a string of electoral successes, they have proven that it is their program and ideas that have won the trust of the voters. Although the leader of the Social Democratic faction, Abe Isu, will retain his post as party president, his position has waned amid the growing influence of Hisashi Asō, the party's general secretary and an ideologue who promotes totalitarian, socialist ideas. Among other things, he is known as a man willing to collude with the military."

 NW_JAP.319.d.a: "After holding its first national congress, Tōhōkai Nakano decided not to dwell on words about “merging Tōhōkai with the masses,” but decided to prove it in words by expanding its electoral base through a merger with the Shakai Taishūtō Party. While many still do not believe such a union is possible, and see it as an unlikely coincidence between the extreme right and left wings of parliamentary politics, the two parties hold similar positions on many issues, including supporting the interests of the military. In addition, some members of Shakai Taishūtō had already defected to Tōhōkai after the police crackdown on “Popular Front” cases - a response to the Comintern's current policy of forming a broad “popular front” among various left-wing organizations. or anti-fascist elements. In the view of many in the leadership of that party, a better alternative to the “popular front” would be a “national front” beginning with a merger with Tōhōkai."

The first contact was made between him and his old acquaintance and erstwhile fellow party leader of the Kokumin Dōmei, Adachi Kenzō. Unexpectedly, it turned out that Adachi was favorably disposed, “provided Shakai Taishūtō abandoned his class character.” After minor negotiations with Shakai Taishūtō leaders, an understanding was reached and now Kokumin Dōmei is also involved in the planned party merger."

Although initially sympathetic, 'provided Shakai Taishūtō abandoned his class character', Adachi was dissuaded from joining by parliamentary groups working on an alternative plan for cross-party unification, in which Ryūtarō Nagai, leader of the pro-war Rikken Minseitō faction, was particularly active."

However, Abe still agreed to the declaration proposed by Nakano, albeit with reservations about his own participation - despite this, it was immediately released to the media. Despite its brevity, it was dramatic in content: it spoke of fulfilling Japan's mission in East Asia by returning to the principle of “service to all the people,” which is at the heart of Japan's national policy that does not allow for “a policy of privilege, cliques, classes or complacency.” It said the parties, whatever their past differences, are united in concern for the nation and the people and, in true “Japanese spirit.” The parties expect sympathizers from all sides to join in the creation of a totalitarian national party, for which a preparatory committee will now be established."

During the banquet, major newspaper owners Tokutomi and Miyake, Shakai Taishutō general secretary Hisashi Asō and Nakano himself spoke. Tiamu, the third “Grand Elder” among prominent Japanese newspaper owners, was dissuaded from attending by fellow members of the Japanist camp, such as representatives of the Great Japan Production Party and the Kokurikai, who jointly accused Nakano of seeking to establish a “totalitarian unified national party of the Western pattern.” Thus, for a time, Nakano and Tiamu were once again separated by this kind of conflict, despite their recent restoration of relations.\n/pThe Preparatory Committee made some progress by choosing the name “Kakushin Shintō” (New Renewal Party), drafting a platform, and setting a date for the inaugural meeting.

In addition, he said that the experience had extinguished in him “the last spark of hope for parliament-centered political maneuvers.” At the end of the interview, he revealed some very intriguing news:\n\n\n- I have decided to directly address the realization of the crisis in Japan and fight for the establishment of a totalitarian Imperial Way Party."

Because of this and his sudden departure during a Sejm session, movements began among the two main parties to expel him from the Sejm. His own support in parliament was quickly eroded after the merger fiasco, and in the end only four Tohokai deputies remained party members. Much of this collapse was attributed to Nakano's excessive admiration for European fascist leaders, his close identification with the army line, and his generally dictatorial views - traits that many in his party hoped would be mitigated by the merger with Shakai Taishuto.\n\nOn his return to Japan, he found that he had no choice but to resign from the Diet. He rejected any suggestion that he might apologize from leaders of various parties. In a public statement, he said:\n\n- The recent failure was my ultimate disappointment in the new party, which is projected to rely on members of the Seimas, and I take full responsibility for this. Given these circumstances, I have now decided to resign from the Sejm and throw myself naked into the thick of the masses."

 NW_JAP.335.d: "After the first news of the National Front promoted by Nakano, the first party to be negotiated with by Shakai Taishuto and Tohokai was Kokumin Domei, the party from which Nakano had left in 1936 because of ideological differences. Rumors had already appeared in the newspapers that the failure of those negotiations was due to Ryutaro's secret machinations, during which he promised Adachi Kenzo, the leader of Kokumin Domei, the creation of a different party coalition, more popular in parliament and without Seigo Nakano, his rival. Ryutaro was now able to confirm these words - Adachi had agreed to his proposal to join. The newspapers had already dubbed this news as "Kokumin Domei returns to the Rikken Minseito", since until 1932 Adachi and his co-partisans had made up the so-called "Adachi faction" within the Minseito."

 NW_JAP.336.d: "Ryutaro Nagai's movement to form a new major party based on Rikken Minshito managed to surprise by having Chikuhei Nakajima's Innovation Alliance, who had been expelled from the Rikken Seiyukai Party, agree to join. Against the backdrop of fighting other parties and in order to establish a solid majority in the Seimas, these people agreed to join such an unexpected alliance. However, we should now clearly expect no less factional infighting than existed until recently in the Seiyukai."
 NW_JAP.336.a: "And Minseito is used to this kind of squabbling"
 NW_JAP.337.t: "Fighting for Deputies"
 NW_JAP.337.d: "From the beginning, Shakai Taishuto had a faction of deputies with social democratic views - they were the centrist and right-wing faction of the Social Democratic Movement. They were the ones most opposed to the party's merger with Tohokai and Ryutaro Nagai was aware of this. It is not surprising, therefore, that his work to create a new party could not but affect these people, many of whom he managed to lure into his movement, which finally had a name. The new party will be called the "New Frontier Party" (Shinshinto), similar to the Progressive Party, one of Rikken Minshito's longtime predecessors."
 NW_JAP.337.a: "We'll see if these actions are justified"
 NW_JAP.338.t: "Fusanosuke Kuhara's Association with the Conspirators."
 NW_JAP.338.d: "In the course of the investigation of the failed putsch, the most surprising fact was the cooperation of the heads of some zaibatsu with the conspiratorial young officers. They themselves justify their actions by a sense of self-preservation due to threats from radicals, since it was the representatives of big capital who were most antagonistic to the young officers as "the people who seized power in the country". Some still believe that using young officers as a tool, the representatives of the zaibatsu wished to carry out reforms in the country that were convenient for themselves and truly seize power.\n\nThe most surprising example of such a person was Fusanosuke Kuhara - one of the leaders of the largest parliamentary party Rikken Seiyukai, its general secretary. His direct participation in the failed coup attempt has not yet been proven, but his financing of the conspirators and their ideologist Ikki Kita has been established.The scandal led to Kuhara's resignation from the party, and he was taken into custody pending a judicial investigation."

 NW_JAP.339.d: "Since 1935, one of the main parliamentary parties, the Rikken Seiyukai, has been in a state of permanent crisis. First, a group of deputies broke away from the party to form the Shōwakai Party in protest of the Seiyukai's policies toward the then cabinet, and the 1936 parliamentary elections dealt a fatal blow to the party's leader, Kisaburo Suzuki. The near defeat in the election and the victory of their main rivals, the Rikken Minseito, with small parties growing in the background destroyed Suzuki's reputation within the party, and also undermined his morale and later his physical condition. It was only through the efforts of his relative, Ichiro Hatoyama, that he managed to win a seat in the House of Peers and retain influence in the party for a while longer. However, amid his deteriorating health, Suzuki announced today that he will step down as party president at the end of his term (in two years), but in the meantime the party will have a four-man collective leadership system: Ichiro Hatoyama himself, Yonezo Maeda, Toshio Shimada and Chikuhei Nakajima. The latter three are representatives of the so-called "pro-war" Seiyukai faction, an influential group in the party that favors cooperation with the army top brass and support for the military's actions."

 NW_JAP.340.d: "Ichiro Hatoyama, one of the leaders of the Rikken Seiyukai Party, is asking for a review of the conviction of Fusanosuke Kuhara, a member of his party who financed the February conspirators. Hatoyama's proposal was supported by a large number of people with their signatures vouching for the former Seiyukai leader's innocence. So far, it is true that his direct involvement in the incident has never been established, but the fact that he was basically funding people like Ikki Kita raises big questions about his political views."

 NW_JAP.341.t: "Kuhara's Reinstatement in the Party"
 NW_JAP.341.d: "As expected, after the charges against Fusanosuke Kuhara were dropped, he was immediately reinstated to the Rikken Seiyukai through the mediation of Ichira Hatoyama. The latter's persistence in trying to bring a man linked to army conspirators back into the party is surprising, but it is rumored to be due to the increasing influence of the Chikuhei Nakajima faction in the Rikken Seiyukai. Nakajima, the owner of the largest zaibatsu that manufactures military and civilian airplanes, has been gradually seizing his power in the party by surrounding himself with people with so-called "pro-war views" in the Seiyukai. It is possible that a shared hatred for Nakajima's reinforcement allowed Hatoyama and Kuhara to overcome their difference of opinion, given the latter's political weight, connections, and influence."

 NW_JAP.342.d: "The time is approaching when the ailing and aged Rikken Seiyukai President Kisaburo Suzuki will finally leave office, ending the party's temporary collective governance regime. However, the conflict between the two factions within it has not died down, but has only flared up with renewed vigor - the Innovation Alliance or Reform Alliance group within the party was formed today. It comes from the reformist faction of Chikuhei Nakajima and his various organizations: The National Policy Research Group and the National Institute for Economic Research, where scholars were invited to conduct research on the political and economic situation at home and abroad. He was the man who promoted and assisted the so-called "new bureaucrats", and he is also a proponent of an alliance with army officers. Apparently, Nakajima and his supporters are preparing to finally seize power in the party."

 NW_JAP.343.d: "Tensions in the Rikken Seiyukai reached a fever pitch after the announcement of the Alliance for Reform. The "outburst" of discontent did not have to wait long. Today, the virtually powerless but formal president of the Rikken Seiyukai, Kizaburo Suzuki, announced that he was removing Chikuhei Nakajima, Yonezo Maeda, and Toshio Shimada from their positions as acting party president. In their place, Fusanosuke Kuhara, Tadaso Mito, and Kenkichi Yoshizawa take their places in the collective leadership. This was reportedly done at the prompting of Ichira Hatoyama, who thus responded to the formation of the Rikken Seiyukai Innovation Alliance. Mito and Yoshizawa are believed to be people from Hatoyama's faction. In addition, it should not be forgotten that in the coming months the period of collective leadership in the Seiyukai is expected to end with the election of a new president and such a castling dramatically strengthens the position of the "heir apparent"."
 NW_JAP.343.a: "Is it Hatoyama's victory?"
 NW_JAP.344.t: "Nakajima Becomes the New Seiyukai President"
 NW_JAP.344.d: "Tensions in the Rikken Seiyukai after the announcement of the Alliance for Reform reached a fever pitch. Various rumors and newspapers reported that because of such divisive behavior Hatoyama decided to take an important step - he turned to the still formally acting party president Kisabura Suzuki and asked him to change the collective presidents from among his opponents, even if it will be Fusanosuke Kuhara's people.\n\nApparently Nakajima, reasonably fearing that Hatoyama's mentor, Suzuki, would take this step, decided to "strike first" and today his faction, mostly members of the Alliance for Reform, gathered at an extraordinary party meeting, to which especially disloyal party members were pragmatically not invited, and proclaimed the end of the period of collective rule and the election of Nakajima as the new president of the Rikken Seiyukai. The meeting was given additional legitimacy by the presence of 3 of the 4 collective presidents, Toshio Shimada and Maeda Yoneza, who have long openly supported Nakajima on almost all issues. So far, the reaction of the remaining party is unknown, but it's worth assuming that they won't just swallow it."

 NW_JAP.346.d: "As promised, the elderly formal president of the Rikken Seiyukai, Kisaburo Suzuki, finally steps down, announcing the election of a new leader and thus ending the period of collective leadership of the party. During this time, two camps clearly emerged in the Seiyukai: the pro-war Nakajima faction and the faction of Hatoyama, Suzuki's successor, which managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Ichiro Hatoyama now leads the country's oldest political party. It is said that Nakajima was extremely upset about this, but not feeling confident underneath himself, he did not dare to engage in divisive actions within the party. Especially since he had already formed a quite powerful, self-loyal Innovation Alliance group within the party a few months ago, without which Hatoyama's own legitimacy would be undermined. However, Hatoyama is rumored to be looking to further develop the party's image as a "pro-constitution" party, reaffirming its name and engaging in ideological confrontation with the more pro-war Rikken Minsaito."

During this time, the Seiyukai clearly formed two camps: the faction of Hatoyama, Hatoyama's successor, who tried to keep the party from indulging in the military, and the faction of Nakajima, his ideological rival, who managed to win the vote. With a sufficient margin, Chikuhei Nakajima now leads the country's oldest political party. As head of the zaibatsu, which produces aircraft, mostly military aircraft, he is actively involved with army and navy officers. Nakajima supports the expansionist aspirations of the army, but does not consider it necessary to eliminate the parliament, and offers them a convenient cooperation in his person. Hatoyama has been unable to reverse the trend within the party to support Nakajima; moreover, the latter has become an overly important financial backer of the party through his financial conglomerate."

 NW_JAP.348.d: "Nakajima's reaction was not to be expected for long, as he announced the withdrawal of his Innovation Alliance from the Rikken Seiyukai in protest. This will severely undermine the party's position in parliament, as over the years Nakajima has managed to build a large faction of loyalists around him. It is true that the Seiyukai is not accustomed to such withdrawals from the party - this is exactly what happened in 1935 with the Shōwakai party - a group of former Seiyukai members who were dissatisfied with the lack of support for the current cabinet from the party leadership. However, the current situation is very different from the Shōwakai in that the Seiyukai leaders will now have to think about finding new sources of funding, as Nakajima had previously provided most of the investment from the income of his zaibatsu."

 NW_JAP.349.d: "After Nakajima's faction voluntarily withdrew from the Rikken Seiyukai, it was impossible to expect any other outcome to the election of the party president than the long-awaited victory of Ichira Hatoyama, as his faction became dominant. Fusanosuke Kuhara could have been a problem, but he failed to gather the necessary coalition around him, and Hatoyama made an important step that dramatically raised his position in the party - a proposal to change the collective leadership, which not only made Kuhara the interim president, but also Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa. During the vote for party president, they thanked Hatoyama and the latter won the required number of votes."

 NW_JAP.350.d: "It did not take long for the rest of the Seiyukai Party to respond - Hatoyama and Kuhara quickly organized an alternative meeting to which they invited all remaining party members. At the meeting, they condemned the actions of the reformist faction and announced the expulsion of Nakajima, Shimada and Yonezo for violating the party charter and arbitrarily seizing power in the party. In their place, Tadaso Mito and Kenkichi Yoshizawa were appointed as acting presidents. The party leaders called their caucus the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai Party. Suzuki finally lost power and was left out, although it is worth noting that unlike the reformists immediately Hatoyama and Kuhara did not go to elect a new president. On the other hand, analysts speculate that this was due to their own ideological antagonism between each other and the "ad hoc alliance" assembled to oppose Nakajima."

 NW_JAP.351.d: "The collapse of the oldest parliamentary party, the Rikken Seiyukai, continues as the "neutral faction" headed by Tsuneo Kanemitsu, Masataka Ota, and Takeru Inukai announced today that it has split from the other two factions. The latter is the son of Tsuyoshi Inukai Tsuyoshi, prime minister of the Seiyukai Inukai, who was assassinated by the military in 1932, but despite this, Tsuneo Kanemitsu, a major bureaucrat and manager of several corporations, is the leader of this group. Their ideological views are rather close to Hatoyama's faction, but they do not support his tactical alliance with Kuhara, a man who has sullied his reputation as the "financial backer of the February 26 putschists". On the other hand, Ota and Inukai are acquaintances of Prince Fumimaro Konoe. But it's worth remembering that the entire "neutral faction" is much smaller than either of the other two Seiyukai factions, precluding the possibility of any strong influence on the political process. And yet, despite this, the main thing that unites the "neutrals" - is the desire to reunify the Rikken Seiyukai, as they told reporters at a press conference."

Despite his position as "Suzuki's heir", Hatoyama's faction was too small within the party. It was also partly influenced by the emergence of the Seiyukai "neutral faction", which Hatoyama is said to have counted on because of their similar ideological views. Other analysts say that Kuhara was chosen as a "mediator" between the two camps of Nakajima and Hatoyama, but it is likely to be of no avail and the party will not be reunited - its leaders are not going to back down."

No comment could be obtained from him on the split in the party as he has been in poor physical condition lately and refuses to give any interviews.\n\nThe new Seiyukai president was Ichiro Hatoyama - Suzuki's heir finally managed to subdue at least the orthodox Rikken Seiyukai faction. This was especially unexpected against the backdrop of the well-known ideological confrontation between "tactical allies" Hatoyama and Kuhara - the latter turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician, thus confirming his financial assistance to the February 26 coup plotters. However, Hatoyama needs to proceed with caution, as Kuhara, with his connections, continues to be a dangerous rival."

Kuhara's expectations were fully confirmed - he envisages the Seiyukai being dissolved so that its example will be followed by other parliamentary parties, and to reaffirm national unity, he advocated a "National Council". Thus he too preaches the "one country, one party" theory. After the Rikken Seiyukai meeting, Kuhara convened a coalition of former members of both houses of parliament and leaders of all branches in Tokyo's Shiba Park and proposed the dissolution of the Rikken Seiyukai Party. Kuhara also met with Fumimaro Konoe and reported in the newspaper."

Apparently realizing that cooperating with Kuhara was a mistake, he decided to take this action. However, these futile attempts were a failure - Kuhara's influence and connections in the political world of Japan are so great that he managed to thwart Hatoyamu and Chuji's plan. Talk that very quickly after forming their alliance, Hatoyama and Kuhara realized that they could not work together has been going around for a long time. Perhaps to Hatoyama's surprise, his "anti-Nakajima ally" turned out to be an even more pro-war and radical politician than Nakajima himself."

Discussions began about the possible formation of a new party, but soon everything was resolved - Hatoyama called an extraordinary meeting of the party, where he announced his resignation and, accordingly, the election of the party president.

 NW_JAP.372.d: "After the death of General Secretary Shakai Taishuto Hisashi Aso, who also headed the National Socialist faction of the party, the latter began to lose strength. Inejiro Asanuma, who was close to him, was so shattered by the grief of the early loss of his comrade that he became depressed and rarely appeared at party meetings. Kenichiro Kamei, left virtually alone, was unable to fully replace them both. As a result, Abe Isu's Social Democratic faction managed to regain influence in the party and their ideology now dominates."

 NW_JAP.373.d: "Prince Konoe had recently secured amnesty for those involved in the Blood League incident, including their leader, Nisho Inoue, a Nithirenist. There had been rumors as to why he did this and why he would stand up for them at all, but the answer was recently revealed that because of his plans for the New System Movement, Konoe had become fearful of a possible assassination attempt by the military, as Konoe's entourage and himself had now realized that powerful military leaders were the main threat to Japan and its future, their unchecked actions in China and other war zones making the civilian government a scapegoat every time.  To prevent this, he has decided to hire as his bodyguards people who would clearly hate those who would try to assassinate the prince - they are old ideological opponents of the currently dominant top army officers. Besides - they are just very good marksmen, since they managed to kill several people during their political terrorist attack."

 NW_JAP.374.t: "A Failed Assassination Attempt on the Prime Minister"
 NW_JAP.374.d: "In Tokyo today, police arrested 38 men among the conspirators who intended to assassinate the Prime Minister and possibly some other officials. They are members of the so-called "god-sent troops," or more specifically, Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto's Japan Youth Party. This formidable organization, rumored to number as many as 100 000 ardent soldiers, was almost like the Colonel's personal army. Its flag, a white sun against a red balloon, symbolized "bloody patriotism under a red-hot sun." Her commander boasted, "Look at me - I'm not a man who can sit back and talk." However, for the past few months, Kingoro Hashimoto seemed to have disappeared from public life, but in fact he has been weaving a web of conspiracy against the current cabinet like a spider. He trusted the idea of Prince Fumimaro Konoe and was one of the most zealous agitators for the dissolution of the old political parties. Apparently, this moral pressure on the prime minister to give up his post to Konoe was the main purpose of Hashimoto's plot. By arresting not only the rank-and-file members of the conspiracy, but also the Colonel himself, we will finally be able to deal with the New System Movement, which has been testing our government in recent months."

 NW_JAP.375.d: "A terrible event happened this morning - Shakai Taishuto party leader Abe Isa was attacked. He is currently living with his wife in the Dojunkai Apartments in Tokyo, modern reinforced concrete buildings built after the Great Earthquake of 1923 for the victims and the needy, and a group of several men came in and rang the doorbell, and when Abe opened it, they hit him between the eyes with a cane with such force that the elderly politician fell to the floor. His wife, hearing something incomprehensible, immediately rushed into the corridor, from where the criminals had already left. Although the injury was not serious, Abe was lucky that his daughter and her husband, physician Tisato Maruyama, live in the same building.\n\nIn response to the attack on their leader, an emergency delegate meeting was held at the Socialist Mass Party headquarters, where it was decided that each faction would be called upon to submit "a resolution of censure regarding the maintenance of public order in the imperial capital". In addition, an opinion calling for the dismissal of Interior Minister Nobumasa Suetsugu was also expressed. Shakai Taishuto MP Jotaro Kawakami has already raised an urgent question in the House plenary and held the minister responsible. Suetsugu responded, "We will take decisive action. We will carefully protect members of parliament"."

His security was beefed up and it is possible that the assassination attempt was thus prevented. In the meantime, the investigation department was able to identify the assailants from a cane bought at a store in Tokyo. It was a group of juvenile ultranationalists who acted on the orders of their leader Toichi Mannen - they turned him in without delay during interrogation.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the reason for their attack was that the leaders of Shakai Taishuto had not abandoned their ideas of establishing socialism in the country at such a crucial historical moment, but on the contrary, they wanted to take advantage of the situation to advance their goal."

 NW_JAP.378.t: "Debate Around the New System"
 NW_JAP.378.d: "The Meiji Constitution contains no legal provisions regarding the procedure for appointing the prime minister. Officially, the emperor, who was the "general ruler of the government", was to exercise the right of appointment at will, unconstrained by legal provisions or the wishes of his subjects. However, if the Prime Minister made a mistake, the Emperor would be responsible for the appointment, and while this was to be avoided, it was also necessary to maintain the format in which the Emperor personally appointed the Prime Minister. After much trial and error during the Meiji period, this issue was resolved by having the emperor's nine unofficial advisors, the genro, advise him on who to appoint as head of the cabinet, and the monarch "accepts" their nomination.However, this solution could not be permanent due to the natural aging and death of the advisors. By the end of the Taisho period, only the great Kimmochi Saionji was alive. From this period onward, the emperors raised the question of a new procedure for appointing the prime minister. Now the time has come for the urgent need to choose one. Among the options under consideration, offered by various of the emperor's inner circle, are the following:\n\n1. Consultation with the Privy Council;\n2. Consultation with senior ministers;\n3.\n\nThe first involves strengthening the powers of the Privy Council, an institutional law-making body under the emperor that advises him on various matters of state. The second involves replacing the genro with a group of people with experience in public service in various government positions, such as former prime ministers. The third, however, proposes a mixture of consultations with the Privy Council and former prime ministers - it is promoted by Koichi Kido, Konoe's closest aide and, like him, a representative of a group of "young aristocrats"."

Here he composed a sharp written indictment of the conduct of the Imperial Japanese Army in China. In it he described the terrible atrocities committed by the Japanese against both civilians and prisoners of war. As an example, he cited an incident that shocked him when an officer told him that the best way to train recruits was to use live Chinese POWs for bayonet practice "because it gives you willpower". He also said that he had been shown army films showing Japanese soldiers gassing Chinese prisoners tied to stakes and attaching bacteriological bombs to planes preparing to bomb Chinese cities. The movie was shown to him personally by General Shiro Ishii, head of Unit 731, based in Manchuria and engaged in the development of such weapons."

 NW_JAP.381.d: "The premiere of the film "Samurai's Daughter" took place today at the Imperial Theater in Tokyo. It is the first joint German-Japanese film project and was produced at the suggestion of the Ministry of Culture of the Empire of Japan.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a successful young man, Yamato Teruo, who returns to Japan after six years of studying at an agricultural college in Germany. Teruo is an adopted son in an old samurai family and is expected to marry Mitsuko, the eldest daughter. However, Teruo has become infected with the idea of Western individualism during his time in Western Europe and refuses to submit to the demands of society. Instead, he confuses his future father-in-law, Yamato Iwao, by announcing that he intends to marry Gerda Storm, a German journalist he met on a ship returning to Japan. Gerda, however, is a blonde, chaste, Aryan woman, and she will not settle for a mixed-race relationship. She tries to convince him of his duty to the Japanese race and traditions and reconcile him with his family. Meanwhile, Mitsuko, feeling humiliated by Teruo's rejection, attempts suicide by throwing herself into a volcano. At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple are romantically reunited.At the last second, she is rescued by Teruo, and the couple is romantically reunited. A short while later, the young couple and their child now live in Manchukuo-Go, "New Earth", working on a farm under the benevolent gaze of a vigilant soldier protecting them from the omnipresent threat of Bolshevism.\n\nThe film brought together an all-star cast of Japanese cinema: Mitsuko is played by the young diva Setsuko Hara, and she would travel to Germany on a tour to premiere the film. The film had two directors, Arnold Funk and Mansaku Itami, which eventually led to two versions of the film, each for its own country. Critics received the movie poorly in our country - they saw it as a condescending treatment of Japan as an exotic eastern nation that needs German political ideas as if it had none of its own. Also, many critics noted the racist ideology of "Blood and Soil", which they found disturbing. However, everyone appreciated Setsuko Hara's performance - she has now gained national and possibly worldwide fame."

Until the very last days of his life, he had a clear mind and, as he continued to follow the news, he commented on certain actions of the national government. For example, he criticized the projects of nationalization of electricity activities as another encroachment of the state and its interference in private life.

General Masaki, who had long been looking for an opportunity to return to such a high position, took advantage of the confusion.

Recalling Hitler's claim that Germany's defeat in the Great War was due to Jewish domination of finance and administration in collusion with the bureaucracy, he drew an analogy to the control of Japan's wartime economy by bureaucrats and their capitalist accomplices in state-supported economic agencies. It was the people, he insisted, who really had the "Jewish mentality", not the people sometimes accused by the new bureaucrats, the independently thinking industrialists, who resisted the dead hand of bureaucratic control and were the ones who were really capable of effectively managing Japan's crisis economy."

However, Nakano himself used it sometimes almost as a pejorative, for example, when responding to an accusation of "fascism", he claimed that it was in fact the "new bureaucrats'" who had actually led the country into "professional bureaucratic fascism". The term first became widely used against him because of his confrontation with Rikken Minseito MP Saito Takao, who is known as a critic of military intervention in politics."

He disparaged them as people who, in practice, were inclined to support the monopoly of the current government.\n\n-They are no longer able to fulfill the hopes of the nation! - They look to mysticism as an outlet for their inadequate arguments and try to convey incomprehensible aspects of this mysticism through classical works that cannot be explained in modern language. Nothing of this kind can satisfy the national sentiments of modern Japan.

In an article warning of this possibility, its leader, Seigo Nakano rejected Chiang Kaishi's prediction from their interview in early 1936 about the consequences of a long-term conflict between Japan and China, denying that the Kuomintang could rally the Chinese people to sustain a resistance similar to that of the Spartans to Persia or Japan to the Mongols because it was a mere puppet of "forces alien to China" and a purely regional power based on the comprador community of the Lower Yangtze."

Accordingly, he decided to visit the leaders of the Axis countries as a "national envoy", as opposed to the usual diplomats representing the supporters of the status quo line of foreign policy. To present him with the appropriate credentials, Tohokai held a mass rally on November 11, 1937, attended by, among other publicly known personalities, the "Three Great Elders": Miyake, Toyama, and Tokutomi So, owners of major national newspapers. The rally was followed by a procession of 3000 supporters carrying flags of the Axis countries and large lanterns bearing the party's name, past the Imperial Palace to the Tokyo train station.

Nakano said that the Japanese people would never allow the government to compromise on China, and added that while the Manchurian Incident, the assassination of prime ministers, and the February uprising might look like the onset of chaos, each of these episodes had improved the situation in Japan. After an hour-long interview, Mussolini authorized Nakano to convey his willingness to enter into a comprehensive alliance with Japan and asked him to record an address to Japanese youth that read, "March straight ahead - straight ahead!

Here too, the Japanese Embassy tried to limit the time of the interview, but Hitler extended it to 50 minutes. During their conversation, Hitler denied any territorial claims in East Asia, hoping only for trade opportunities, the main obstacle to which was the Comintern. He hoped Japan would solve the problem, but hoped the war would not be too debilitating. To this, Nakano assured him that the real battle was already over. The Kuomintang was now just a regional force. Nakano later described Hitler as much more cautious and deliberative in his discussions than Mussolini, who always had ready answers."

Kanji Ishiwara, who attended the meetings, lamented the callousness of the staff officers who quietly listened as Nakano "shamelessly expounded his amateurish strategy". It's worth remembering that Ishiwara was the center of resistance to launching a full-scale war with China in the army. And apparently despite their earlier close relationship (Ishiwara was Nakano's military advisor), they are now distancing themselves from each other."

 NW_JAP.394.d: "Seigo Nakano's visit to the European fascist powers was accompanied by a major media campaign. A handout prepared by his diplomatic advisor Nakayama Masaru for distribution during his visit described Nakano as the central figure of the "renewal movement", Japan's greatest orator, a true Japanese in his faults and virtues, an economist of the Friedrich List school (whom he had studied at Waseda University and sometimes quoted, though not as a central authority), and a Confucian idealist, strengthened by personal tragedy and now living "the stoic life of a Zen monk".\n\nThe image he himself tried to project was definitely reminiscent of his assessment of Hitler, whom he described as a mere "patriot" from the lower strata of German society, whom he was for that reason "honored to represent". Similarly, "it is to our Tohokai that the privilege of leading our society has been entrusted". He regarded Hitler's loyalty as demonstrated by his celibacy and vegetarianism, just as Mussolini abstained from alcohol and tobacco."

Its members wore a uniform consisting of a black field cap, a dark blue shirt, a dark red tie, and an armband depicting a swastika based on the initial character "Tohokai", meaning "East".\n\nNakano's own appearance changed so noticeably that an old friend of Ogata's commented, "His black fascist uniform, the emblem resembling a Nazi swastika on his armband, and his trips to Europe all make me think he's lost his mind".

 NW_JAP.396.d: "The main ideologue of "agrarian expansionism" was Kato Kanji, an educator and agriculturist who has been running his own agricultural school for farmers and possible settlers in Manchuria for several years. He has his own coherent belief system, which assumes that the farmers will cultivate the land they receive on their own, thus returning to the "original Yamato spirit", purge internal moral issues, and become a solid support for the imperial throne. In addition, he suggests that they will abandon modern capitalist mechanization of labor and return to manual farming. Also, Kato believes that this is where the true spirit of "soldier-farmers" will be realized, as he believes that settlers should be armed with light small arms and be ready to defend their newly acquired land.\n\nHe is also assisted in this by Colonel Togu Tetsuo of the Kwantung Army, who is also interested in colonizing Manchuria, as this will make it easier to control all of Manchukuo-Go's lands and will be a powerful weapon in the future war with the Soviet Union - for this purpose the settlers are given plots of land along the border with the USSR. Togu suggests that when the war begins, Japanese farmers will be able to help the Kwantung Army with food supplies and fight guerrillas infiltrating across the border. It is worth noting, however, that Kato did not envision his settlers cooperating with the Kwantung Army, but in the end did not refuse the colonel's help."

 NW_JAP.397.d: "Kato and his supporters were disappointed when the settlers in Manchuria turned out to be landowners rather than altruistic farmers and preferred modern farming methods. Instead of improving national fortunes and morals, they sought security and a comfortable life. This included hiring Chinese as laborers on their land holdings. This reality led Kato to cut back on recruiting adult settlers and instead focus on adolescents, who would presumably be young people with high goals. To this end, he convinced the Ministry of Agriculture to create a Youth Volunteer Corps for Manchurian development and personally train them in "Yamatobataraki" ("working for the Yamato")."

In any case, since we do not have a border with the USSR, Japan will take the main blow, and we will only support it in this confrontation at sea, in the air and with arms, and most importantly - it will distract Japan for a long time from attempts to seize our Asian possessions."

 NW_JAP.405.d: "The Chinese Army agreed to let in a group of our troops to inspect Wanping Fortress and search for a missing soldier. In the course of this effort, our soldier was found in the basement, tied up. The Chinese were shocked by what they saw and returned our soldier.

 NW_JAP.410.d: "Song Zheyuan, head of the Hebei Chahar Political Council, sent his representative Zhen Zizhong to Tianjin to meet with Japanese General Hashimoto, commander of all Japanese troops in the areas near Beijing and Tianjin. At the outset of the talks, he indicated that he believed the incident could be resolved peacefully. The Japanese promised not to attack Peking and Tianjin under the following conditions:\n\n1. The Kuomintang must expel all anti-Japanese organizations from the cities and stop anti-Japanese demonstrations;\n2. The Kuomintang should take full responsibility for the July 7 incident;\n3. Song Zheyuan, not any lower-ranking officer, should personally apologize for the incident.\n\nIn addition, Japanese representatives told Zheng that they would prefer to see him as the head of the Beijing and Hebei Chahar Council. Zhen agreed to the first two conditions, but said that he could not decide the personal issue for Sun, and thus could not accept the third condition."

 NW_JAP.412.t: "Continued Hostilities"
 NW_JAP.412.d: "Despite general attempts at a peaceful resolution of the incident, Japanese artillery resumed shelling Wanping this morning and their troops moved forward across the bridge. Perhaps the last chance to stop the Japanese invasion will be for Song Zheyuan to step down and be replaced by Zhen Zizhong, who has been holding talks with the Japanese side."

 NW_JAP.415.b: "It's time to achieve our goals through war"
 NW_JAP.416.t: "Cessation of Hostilities"
 NW_JAP.416.d: "The Japanese army stopped the escalating conflict at the Marco Polo Bridge. It seems that the seemingly inevitable war with Japan has managed to bypass us this time. It is true that we should not expect Japan not to stop its attempts to take control of the lands of North China. The most surprising thing is that a Japanese soldier in the territory of Wanping Fortress was indeed found and handed over to the Japanese side."

In all likelihood this conflict will escalate into a full-blown Sino-Japanese war and we need to think of ways to escape from Japanese control without tarnishing our reputation. We can send a secret telegram to General Sun asking him to send troops to Tongzhou to try to free it from Japanese control."

 NW_JAP.421.t: "A Kuomintang unit at the city gates"
 NW_JAP.421.d: "A detachment of Chinese troops arrived at the city walls of our capital Tongzhou and camped in formation. The commander of the garrison of Japanese troops in Tongzhou ordered them to leave the area and return to the location of his army in Hebei Chahar, but the Chinese soldiers silently refused to leave. Otherwise, he threatened to disarm the Kuomintang troops."

 NW_JAP.422.t: "Song Zheyuan's Rejection"
 NW_JAP.422.d: "Perhaps because of mistrust, or perhaps because of lack of our own forces, General Sun has refused to help us organize an anti-Japanese uprising. In all likelihood, we will either have to act on our own or remain loyal to Japan."

 NW_JAP.423.t: "Tongzhou Uprising"
 NW_JAP.423.d: "Events in our capital began to unfold with incredible speed. When the Japanese garrison commander ordered the disarmament of the Kuomintang troops, the latter, despite their small numbers, gave battle to a superior garrison of East Hebei troops. Sandwiched between the city wall and the Japanese army, they continued their suicide mission. The East Hebei divisions, manned by ethnic Chinese, were inspired by this feat, and they defected to the resisting side. It was the perfect time to cross over to the rebel side."
 NW_JAP.423.a: "Our plan worked perfectly"
 NW_JAP.424.t: "Tongzhou Mutiny"
 NW_JAP.424.d: "The autonomous government of East Hebei, whose leader is the Chinese Yin Rugen, has rebelled against our authority! A detachment from Song Zheyuan's army came to the city walls of Tongzhou, after which a battle broke out between him and our troops. Unexpectedly, the divisions of the army of East Hebei, staffed by Chinese, came to the side of the Chinese, as a result of which our loyal units were defeated and almost completely killed. Only a few dozen soldiers and 60 civilians of the city who were living there in our concession managed to escape from Tongzhou. They report the horrors that took place in the city after the Chinese soldiers took possession of it. Most of the women were raped and killed in perverted ways. Men were brutally murdered and dismembered."

 NW_JAP.425.d: "Today, after a routine inspection of our army units stationed in Tianjin, near Beijing, the command discovered that one of our army soldiers was missing.

 NW_JAP.426.t: "Missing Found"
 NW_JAP.426.d: "During a joint search by a Sino-Japanese commission, a soldier of the Imperial Army of Japan was found tied up in a cellar.

 NW_JAP.428.d: "The disgraceful expulsion of our armies from China has not only brought down the credibility of the military, but also undermined the credibility of the civilian government. The Prime Minister [ROOT.GetLeader] had already forwarded a message to the Emperor that he was taking responsibility for what had happened and wished to resign. The emperor's entourage felt it was the right thing for the prime minister to do, as it takes the shadow of shame away from the emperor. In such an unstable environment, the Emperor's uncle, Prince Naruhiko, volunteered to form a temporary emergency government, as the situation in the country had reached a breaking point - for many decades Japan had not faced such a situation when its army suffered a terrible defeat, and since it had great influence in pre-war politics, it would now shake up the entire state system."

 NW_JAP.429.d: "Parliamentary leaders have started reforming their factions. However, this does not mean the emergence of radical new associations - they are essentially the old parties of the 1930s, given more modern names. Thus, the Shakai Taishuto became the Socialist Party of Japan. The Rikken Seiyukai changed its name to the Liberal Party of Japan, and the Rikken Minseito to the Progressive Party of Japan. Almost all deputies remained committed to the parties from which they were elected this term."

 NW_JAP.430.d: "Konoe preferred death to the humiliation of a war crimes trial. The night before he was sent to Sugamo Prison, his son Michitaka searched his room for weapons and poison. That night Konoe and his son spoke at length about the past war and the heavy responsibility he felt to the emperor and the Japanese people. Fumimaro wrote down in pencil his feelings on these matters at his son's insistence.\n\nThen they sat in silence until Michitaka told his father to go to bed and asked if he was going to leave tomorrow. Fumimaro didn't answer, and they stared at each other in silence. Michitaka had never seen such a strange and unpleasant expression on his father's face and for the first time he sensed his intention to die.\n\nShortly before dawn, Michitaka was awakened by his mother's excited voice.When he entered his father's room, Fumimaro was stretched out and looked as calm and serene as if he were asleep. An empty brownish bottle lay next to his pillow. He had committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide."

 NW_JAP.431.d: "A few months ago our occupation forces in Japan arrested several dozen Japanese military officers and politicians who had participated in the administration of the country during the war. The politicians and some generals were being investigated for their participation in launching wars of conquest, and most of the officers were being investigated for the commission of war crimes by their subordinates in the conquered territories. During this time, each of them was investigated individually, taking into account the available material and the interrogation of witnesses, as well as their own cross-examinations. In the end, the main unifying feature of all those arrested was the words about the "innocence of the emperor". It is up to us to decide what punishment to mete out to these men."

The court panel was composed of representatives of different countries in order to achieve maximum impartiality, but many still dubbed this event "victors' justice". There were a huge number of people on the bench, and the investigation and interrogations went on for months.

 NW_JAP.433.d: "Japan needs a new constitution because the old one has allowed radical forces to come to power in the country. It is quite clear that the parliament will be the center of the new political system of the country, but the most important question we need to decide is whether to keep the monarchy in the country or not.\n\nOn the one hand, the members of the imperial house are tainted by their involvement in war crimes, and the monarch himself did not stop his subordinates when necessary. On the other hand, many analysts and experts on Japan believe that the emperor could not have done so, so it is difficult to blame him for starting the war. Moreover, there are fears that abandoning the monarchy would turn the vast majority of the country's population against us and threaten to start a civil war, since the Japanese are very loyal to their emperor and the dynasty that has ruled the country for more than 2000 years.\n\nWe should also consider a constitution proposed by the Japanese politicians themselves from the current government. These politicians are trustworthy, as they ruled the country during the Taisho democracy, but their draft of the main document of the country is almost a complete copy of the old Meiji constitution with some cosmetic changes and lack of such a strong influence of the military."

 NW_JAP.444.t: "Four Handshakes"
 NW_JAP.444.d: "Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi is one of the main ideologists of the Pan-European Union in the world, but few people know that he was born into a mixed family of the Austro-Hungarian chargé d'affaires in Japan, Heinrich von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and a Japanese woman, Mitsuko Aoyama, the daughter of a large merchant. It is possible that it was this connection with Japan that saved the life of the young contemporary philosopher. Since the late 1920s, Kalergi had been in conflict with the NSDAP and Adolf Hitler in absentia, and after their rise to power, this became a direct threat to his life. In 1938 he published his last book, The Totalitarian State Against Man, after which he had to change country after country, hiding from persecution. Eventually, he was able to find asylum in Lisbon and then leave for the United States thanks to the Japanese ambassador, with whom he developed a good relationship. As a parting gift, the Count left the Ambassador a signed copy of this book. The ambassador, in turn, lent the book to the international journalist Shigeharu Matsumoto, who in turn lent it to the political scientist Asaso Ichimura of Waseda University. As a person close to Ichira Hatoyama, he gave the book to the prime minister, asking him to translate it into Japanese for wide distribution. Hatoyama was so taken by the ideas described in the book that he inquired about his fate and decided to establish a "Yuai" or "Brotherhood" in the country."
 NW_JAP.444.a: "Who's Yuai?"
 NW_JAP.445.t: "Brotherhood"
 NW_JAP.445.d: "The goal of the "Brotherhood" ("Yuai"), based on the Kudenhove-Kalergi philosophy, is to create a kinder world through motherly love. This theory includes mutual respect, mutual understanding, mutual aid, humanism, individualism, cooperation, chivalry, bushido, and building human relationships as if everyone is "ladies and gentlemen". The three principles of brotherhood are the philosophy of the fraternal movement: mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual aid (or mutual cooperation) based on the dignity of individuality. In addition, Hatoyama is known to have recently joined a Masonic lodge in Tokyo.\n\nThe move to create the Yuai suggests that Hatoyama not only liked the European philosopher's ideas, but also the prime minister's personal problems. In the early 1930s, as a cabinet member and protégé of Kisaburo Suzuki, he dealt a severe blow to the reputation of democratic parties and the idea of party cabinets, which indirectly helped the military to disintegrate for a time and nearly seize power in the country. Hatoyama was also directly to blame for the curtailment of academic freedom of speech when he forced the dismissal of a left-wing professor from Kyoto Imperial University in 1933.  Soon enough he realized what all these actions had brought the country to, and from that point on he began trying to repair the political system from the wounds he himself had had a hand in.\n\nThis was the task that drove Hatoyama all along - atoning for his own sin and restoring his reputation. It was for this reason that Kudenhove-Kalergi's book struck at the Prime Minister's heart and won his trust. And today he seems to be able to relax - he has succeeded in fulfilling the goal he set for himself."

 NW_JAP.446.d: "We need to make a decision about the abolition of the Japanese monarchy. On the one hand, members of the imperial house have been tainted by their involvement in war crimes, and the monarch himself did not stop his subordinates when necessary. On the other hand, many analysts and experts on Japan are of the opinion that the emperor could not have done this, so it is difficult to blame him for starting the war. Moreover, there are fears that abandoning the monarchy will turn the vast majority of the country's population against us and create a threat of civil war, as the Japanese are very loyal to their emperor and the dynasty that has ruled the country for more than 2000 years."
 NW_JAP.446.a: "Japan must become a republic"
 NW_JAP.446.b: "Japan may retain a symbolic monarchy"
 NW_JAP.447.t: "The monarchy is Preserved"
 NW_JAP.447.d: "The occupation authorities, after a short debate, agreed to maintain the monarchy and not to touch the emperor. This will allow our reforms to be as effective as possible and to be accepted by the people."
 NW_JAP.447.a: "That's great."
 NW_JAP.448.t: "Peasant Uprising"
 NW_JAP.448.d: "We were unable to keep the situation within moderate limits - popular discontent erupted into civil war. In one of the remote mountainous areas of the countryside, local peasant groups managed to completely seize their power and proclaimed the creation of a new imperial army. Their goal was to expel foreigners and restore the monarchy in the country."
 NW_JAP.448.a: "We need to tame these lunatics"
 NW_JAP.448.b: "We will liberate our country and restore the Emperor's power!"
 NW_JAP.449.t: "The Rebellion of the Nitiren Sect"
 NW_JAP.449.d: "Another side of the conflict became involved in the disaster: religious radicals from the Nitiren Buddhist sect, whose members had attempted a coup d'état in the early 1930s, reared their heads again. Their leader, Nisho Inoue, managed to attract some areas of the countryside and mobilize former soldiers in the confusion of mass disobedience."
 NW_JAP.449.a: "This nightmare just keeps getting worse"
 NW_JAP.449.b: "One man, one murder!"
 NW_JAP.450.t: "Communist Uprising"
 NW_JAP.450.d: "Our saddest predictions are coming true - in one part of the country the Communists have risen up and organized their own government, which will fight the occupation and "help the common people". We know that such cheap populism allowed the Bolsheviks to come to power in Russia and now their comrades want to repeat that success."
 NW_JAP.450.a: "We're not going to let them do that!"
 NW_JAP.450.b: "Let's liberate the people from the oppression of imperialism"
 NW_JAP.451.t: "Anarchist Uprising"
 NW_JAP.451.d: "The civil war was getting more and more terrible. A new uprising was organized by anarchists, who had been underground for a long time and seemed almost completely destroyed. It is hard to expect strong resistance from them, unless of course they receive help from abroad."
 NW_JAP.451.a: "We will crush the anarchists this time too"
 NW_JAP.451.b: "People will no longer be suppressed by the state!"
 NW_JAP.452.t: "Communist Underground in Japan"
 NW_JAP.452.d: "After the decision of the occupation authorities to abolish the Japanese monarchy, the country was one step away from a full-fledged civil war. Now the local authorities are trying to prevent this bloody outcome, but this is an opportunity for us to win the Japanese people to our side by secretly supporting the communist underground in Japan."
 NW_JAP.452.a: "We'll do our best"
 NW_JAP.453.t: "Anarchist Underground in Japan"
 NW_JAP.453.d: "After the decision of the occupation authorities to abolish the Japanese monarchy, the country was one step away from a full-fledged civil war. Now the local authorities are trying to prevent this bloody outcome, but this is an opportunity for us to lure the Japanese people to our side by secretly supporting the anarchist underground in Japan."
 NW_JAP.453.a: "We'll do our best"
 NW_JAP.454.t: "Choice of Regent"
 NW_JAP.454.desc: "Since the new emperor is too young to rule on his own, we need to choose someone to be his regent and perform his basic duties and, under the current political conditions, to rule the country completely. It could be one of the former Emperor Hirohito's brothers, or his uncle Prince Naruhiko, who has good political sense. However, he has ties to the army, which could negatively affect the authority of the throne."
 NW_JAP.454.a: "Prince Titibu will become Regent"
 NW_JAP.454.b: "Prince Takamatsu will become Regent."
 NW_JAP.454.c: "Prince Mikasa will become Regent"
 NW_JAP.454.d: "Prince Naruhiko will become regent"
 NW_JAP.455.t: "The Fate of the Imperial Family"
 NW_JAP.455.d: "We need to decide the fate of the former Japanese monarch and his family. As in Russia, he is an important symbol for the counter-revolutionary resistance and our intelligence services are already reporting attempts to "summon" the monarchs from prison. For this reason, perhaps we should try them all and execute them, so that the various conspirators don't even have the desire to try to restore the monarchy. On the other hand, this would further undermine the resistance to our government, so maybe we should just send them into exile."
 NW_JAP.455.a: "Everyone must be removed so that no one can claim the throne"
 NW_JAP.455.b: "Only the former emperor is on trial"
 NW_JAP.455.c: "They can leave the country"

 JAP_Naisen_Ittai: "Naisen Ittai"
 JAP_Naisen_Ittai_desc: "Korea had a great chance of becoming an independent state in Asia on a par with China and Japan - the Russian Empire stood up for it, seeking to weaken its neighbors in this way. However, the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War led to the expulsion of the Russians from the Korean peninsula and despite the continued assistance from the "White Tsar" (support of Korean diplomats at the international level, financing and arming of Korean guerrillas), 5 years later Korea was under the direct rule of the Japanese Empire in 1910, when the last (already puppet) Emperor of Korea Sunjong transferred all his sovereign power to the Japanese Emperor..\n\nIn 25 years, a whole generation of people who had never lived outside the Japanese Empire had grown up - and they had virtually lost interest in the idea of national independence, given how brutally any anti-Japanese demonstrations were suppressed. Koreans have become willing to put up with it if they can have some cultural autonomy: the ability to learn the Korean language, publish newspapers in it, and create art.\n\nThis long road will gradually lead to the full integration of Koreans and basically make them full citizens of the Empire, but it is resisted by members of the army, who are most often appointed as governors general of Korea. Leaving the Koreans in limbo will allow them to be used as cheap labor or perhaps even cannon fodder in future wars."

However, due to the outbreak of civil war in China, this was fraught with a number of difficulties and dangers, especially for the Japanese population. Therefore, the number of agrarian settlers amounted to a measly few hundred people.\n\nAfter the onset of the Great Depression, the condition of the country's peasant population deteriorated further, and many members of the Nohonshugi movement began to urge the government to pay attention to the plight of impoverished peasants. After the creation of Manchukuo, one way of solving this problem was to possibly help Japanese farmers resettle in Manchuria. In this way, we will also eliminate the problem of land shortage due to the growing population of the archipelago."

At the same time, he considers it necessary to expel the British Empire from the Suez Canal to liberate India and other oppressed Asian nations. In addition, an alliance with China must be made to prevent its partition as Europe once did with Africa. China itself must also start a war with the Soviet Union, in which Japan will support it by concluding an alliance with France - according to Ikki Kita, the French have not yet forgiven the Bolsheviks for nationalizing their assets in the Russian Empire, so they will be ready to support the war against Moscow."

 JAP_turanist_union_category_desc: "In the 1920s and 1930s, Turanism gained some support in Japan, mainly among the military elite and intellectuals. Japanese Turanists argued that the Japanese were of inland Asian origin and that the ancestors of the Japanese had migrated from Central Asia to conquer the Japanese islands. Kitagawa Shikazo argued that the Japanese were descended from the Tungus branch of the Turanian family, just like the Koreans and Manchus, whose roots were in northeast China, in Manchuria. And since the Japanese, Koreans and Manchus were descended from the Tungus, they also had links with other Turanian sub-ethnic groups such as the Turks, Mongols, Samoyeds and Finno-Ugri in terms of blood, language and culture. Over 20 years, several organizations had been established to strengthen cooperation with the Turanist countries and to print relevant literature. They insist that the Japanese leave the tragically small Japanese islands and move to the northern and western parts of the Asian continent where their ancestors once lived. To do this, they will have to reclaim these ancestral lands from the Slavs by making an alliance with the Turanian peoples."

Moreover, since the founders of the Society were rather highly ideologised ultra-nationalists and to some extent independent from the authorities, sometimes their policy was quite realistically at odds with the line of the state, sometimes leading to acts of struggle between the government and the Society. Thus, for example, since the beginning of the century they have supported various anti-colonial movements in Asia - in India, the Philippines and China. It is no secret that both Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kaishi are friends of the founders of the Amur River Society. One of Kōdōha's goals was to bring the Amur River Society to manage the country's foreign policy as the persons who are most interested in and consistently advocate the ideas of pan-Asianism in the world."

The first such successful experience came during the Russo-Japanese War, when uprisings in the Russian Caucasus were organised with Japanese support. These ties have only grown stronger over time, and perhaps now it is time for the government to openly begin to make alliances with the Muslim countries of the Middle East, thus ‘incorporating’ them into Greater Asia."
