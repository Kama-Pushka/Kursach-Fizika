 wtt_germany.1.d: "Latent dissatisfaction with Hitler's rule has come to a head with the current crisis, caused by the administration's move to remilitarize the Rhineland. A number of Wehrmacht generals have rallied behind general Ludwig Beck, who has put in motion plans aiming to depose Hitler, and to remove the Nazi party from Germany.\n\nWith the split in the German high command becoming clearly apparent even abroad, foreign powers have elected not to protest against the remilitarization, more concerned with the growing internal German instability. Beck together with a group of conspirators has moved quickly, already establishing a provisional government, to which scores have flocked in their opposition to the Nazi government.\n\nThe military coup is already well on its way."
 wtt_germany.7.t: "Unchecked Economic Dependency on [From.GetName]"
 wtt_germany.7.d: "With the gradual spiral deeper into [From.GetNameDef]'s sphere of influence, our economy has become more and more dependent on that of our ally. When, today, the Germans at last moved to take further control over our economy, we were powerless to stop them. As a result, German control over our foreign policy has reached unprecedented levels."
 wtt_germany.8.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approached pro-monarchy and anti-fascist elements of the Italian government and the underground with plans for the assassination of Mussolini and the institution of Victor Emmanuel III as leader of the nation. The Germans ensure us they can handle the assassination; all we have to do is affirm our willingness to create a replacement government, and to pledge our future military support to German endeavours."
 wtt_germany.11.d: "The German plan has been put in action and Mussolini was shot in his car in the streets of Rome today. King Victor Emmanuel III has taken the reins of the nation, and has pledged to join the Central Powers alongside [From.GetNameDef]."
 wtt_germany.12.d: "Our plan has been executed flawlessly, and Vittorio Emanuele III has taken up the mantle of leadership of his nation. His first act was to sign a treaty ensuring Italian entry into the Central Powers alliance."
 wtt_germany.14.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with an offer that they say may benefit both parties. In light of the current political situation, and the threat on our Eastern border, the Germans propose to issue a guarantee that they will come to our military aid in the event that we come to war with [SOV.GetNameDef]. In return, they only ask for the return of their lost territories of Danzig and Poznan."

The Nazis, Royalists, and Democrats alike have taken up arms against their former countrymen, and military units have been removed from the borders to see to the internal threat.\n\nThe nazis, under orders of Hitler, have already vowed to destroy the nation rather than see it fall to 'treasonous Germans'."

 wtt_japan.40.desc: "A few days ago, the government of [From.GetNameDef] began a concerted effort to apply pressure on us. Lead articles in newspapers demanded that we return Manchuria to [From.GetAdjective] control.
