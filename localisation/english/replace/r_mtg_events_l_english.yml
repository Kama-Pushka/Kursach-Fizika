The [From.GetRulingPartyLong] propaganda ministry has requested that all remaining American soldiers in the area give up their arms and respect the 'peaceful handover of power' in the Canal Zone. The American president has been heavily criticized by the 'gutter press' for not fighting harder to preserve national interests in the area, and for failing to follow up the [From.GetAdjective] attack with a general mobilization against [From.GetNameDef]."

 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.20.desc: "At 8:00 AM today, a special envoy from [CSAcapital.GetName] arrived at the White House to deliver to President [USA.GetLeader] a note from the State Legislation announcing that [CSAcapital.GetName] will no longer consider itself part of the republic. Claiming that this is a fundamental right of any civilized people - and quoting extensively from the Declaration of Independence - the note also stated emphatically that a peaceful secession is in everyone's interest and that the new state wishes nothing more than to conduct its own affairs as a good neighbor of [USA.GetNameDef]."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.22.desc: "Following the outbreak of hostilities between [USA.GetNameDef] and [CSA.GetNameDef], a number of state legislatures have passed motions of non-intervention. These laws order the governor to maintain the territorial integrity of the state and prevent combat troops from either side from entering. They further ban any kind of recruitment efforts by either side but, crucially, do not restrict the sale of arms and munitions to either party in the conflict provided that payment is rendered beforehand. \n\nThe motions also stress that the states consider themselves to be part of [USA.GetNameDef] and do not wish to form their own permanent government."

 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.201.desc: "As our forces have advanced into [CSA_liberated_state.GetName], they have come across a large number of sympathetic citizens who have long harbored hidden sympathies towards us. Swept up in a wave of patriotic fervor, they have asked to join our military."

 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.203.desc: "A group calling themselves the [USA_state_government_created.GetName] Citizen Council have announced that they have taken over administration of [USA_state_government_created.GetName] from [CSA.GetAdjective] military authorities. While they claim no affiliation in the ongoing conflict, they also announced that they would implement several new laws dealing with recruitment for the [CSA.GetAdjective] military.\n\nAs part of the announcement, they have declared that whatever congressional delegates still remain in the capital are no longer representing the people of [USA_state_government_created.GetName]."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.1.desc: "Another wave of mass protests has hit the capital, with demonstrations clogging every major road in and around the Capitol Building. Organized by the "Action Committee for the Preservation of the Republic", the protesters demanded an independent investigation into allegations of corruption and misconduct in the administration of President [USA.GetLeader]. In particular, they demanded that the President denounce the Silver Legion and publicly assure them that their rights as voters will be respected.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] has refused to comment on the issue."
 mtg_usa_canadian_corridor.1.desc: "Our ambassador in [USA.GetNameDef] was summoned to the Department of State today and presented with an ultimatum. According to the note handed to him, government of [USA.GetNameDef] can no longer accept Canadian sovereignty over the areas between Washington and Alaska. \n\nSuggestions to negotiate a treaty allowing passage of troops and exemption from certain border controls were flatly refused. The [USA.GetAdjective] government expects an answer by midnight."
 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.1.desc_b: "A delegation of the [USA.GetAdjective] government has arrived to discuss plans for our common defense. It appears that President [USA.GetLeader] considers our little part of the world of vital interest to the security of [USA.GetNameDef]. Beyond a simple guarantee to come to our aid, however, the [USA.GetAdjective] government wants to ensure that we ourselves can not become a threat. For this reason, the agreement comes with a number of provisions that will allow [USA.GetNameDef] a significant say in how we conduct our internal matters.\n\nWhile the threat of war has not been made in the negotiations so far, it clear that President [USA.GetLeader] would consider our refusal a very hostile act."
 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.3.desc: "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to even meet with our delegation, claiming that there are no outstanding issues between our nations. However, the military attaches in [GET_AUSTRALIA_NEW_ZEALAND_STATUS] have reported a significant increase in military maneuvers recently."
 mtg_usa_secure_asia.1.desc: "President [USA.GetLeader] has sent a special representative to the capital to meet with [This.GetLeader] and discuss the renewed interest of [USA.GetNameDef] in the area. [This.GetNameDefCap] evidently forms the linchpin of [USA.GetAdjective] strategy for the region. As such, it has been communicated to our government that [USA.GetNameDef] can not tolerate an unfriendly or indeed hostile government in [This.GetNameDef]."
 mtg_usa_secure_asia.6.desc:2 "Negotiations with [From.GetNameDef] have collapsed almost as soon as they started. The [From.GetAdjective] cabinet discussed our note for less than an hour before summarily rejecting it. The [From.GetAdjective] foreign minister has informed our ambassador that unless the proposal is substantially altered, there is nothing to discuss."
 mtg_usa_secure_asia.7.desc: "As part of a larger diplomatic offensive, President [USA.GetLeader] has publicly identified Vietnam and Indochina as a region of vital interest to [USA.GetNameDef]. Therefore, [USA.GetNameDef] will aim to increase their presence in the area.\n\nPrivately, [USA.GetNameDef] have been making very aggressive noises about Indochina. Aside from exerting pressure on [SIA.GetNameDef], they have also demanded the right to station troops in our colonies and to 'direct' the colonial administration. \n\nIn effect, this would amount to ceding those territories to their control."
 mtg_usa_protect_south_america.3.desc: "The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] have hurriedly left the summit to travel home. The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has so far refused to comment on this, claiming to still be waiting on instructions from home."

 mtg_usa_diplomatic_protest.2.desc: "In a speech before both houses of Congress, President [USA.GetLeader] has announced that his government remains committed to the Monroe Doctrine, which states that no outside power should be allowed to hold teritory in the Americas. While, in practice, the [USA.GetAdjective] government has tolerated other [USA.GetRulingIdeology] countries holding small territories, it can not accept what he called an "illegal occupation and direct threat to the security of [USA.GetNameDef]". \n\nShortly afterwards, the [USA.GetAdjective] ambassador handed over a note with an ultimatum from the President to hand over control of our American holdings to [USA.GetNameDef]."
 mtg_usa_diplomatic_protest.4.desc: "Calling our note an "unacceptable intrusion into internal matters of [From.GetNameDef]", the [From.GetAdjective] government has flatly refused to discuss their sovereignty over their American territories."

 panay_incident.3.d: "In response to our sinking of the USS Panay earlier this week, [USA.GetNameDef] has demanded an apology, punishment of the officers involved and compensation. While the attack was not ordered by our Government, it is not entirely clear whether it was a mistake by over-enthusiastic pilots or an attempt by military hardliners to encourage [USA.GetNameDef] and [ENG.GetName] to pull their forces out of [CHI.GetName]. Some in the Government will not like us agreeing to [USA.GetAdjective] terms, but a refusal could mean war."
 mtg_netherlands.15.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has come up with a proposal to re-form the United Netherlands buffer state that existed in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars. They cite their contributions to the war effort, compared to the relative uselessness of the Belgians and the Luxembourgians, as a reason for why they should not only be rewarded, but also for why this plan would aid the keeping of continental peace in the future."
 mtg_netherlands.21.d: "It has become clear from our interactions that [From.GetNameDefCap] is seeking to secure their control over our affairs... Already certain minor duplicate branches of government have been deemed 'unnecessary', henceforth being managed directly from Amsterdam."
 mtg_netherlands.25.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has informed us that our proposal is not of interest to them."

 mtg_netherlands.61.d: "[From.GetNameDef] has not backed down, and refuses to issue an apology for the insulting accusations and slander aimed at Prince Bernhard. Whether they are correct and the Prince has interfered in domestic issues or not is besides the point - we now have reached the breaking point in international relations."
 mtg_news.14.t: "[GetNewsHeadline][From.GetName] Revisits Colonial Policy"
 mtg_news.14.desc: "At a speech today, [From.GetLeader] announced a change in the nation's colonial policy. "Recognizing the rights of all peoples for self-determination, the [From.GetAdjective] government has resolved to set all Imperial subjects on the path to independence, the conclusion of which is intended to occur within the foreseeable future."\n\nIn response to concerns that this would greatly weaken [From.GetNameDef]'s position in the world, [From.GetLeader] stated that "all nations that desire to do so will be welcome to remain as a member of a newly-founded community of nations, but then as fully equal and independent parties". It remains to be seen whether any nations will accept the offer."

Despite the [From.GetAdjective] government's invitation for former subjects to join the [From.GetFactionName], many have chosen to go their own way.\n\nThe move continues to be controversial domestically, but is greatly applauded by socialists internationally. What weakness this has caused for [From.GetNameDef]'s position in the world remains to be seen, as does the situation of those nations who elected to go their own way."

 mtg_news.16.desc: "In a public statement today, the new [From.GetAdjective] Prime Minister [From.GetLeader] has announced the new government's intention to steer away from the course of Appeasement their predecessors had loyally maintained. In no uncertain terms, [From.GetLeader] made it clear that [From.GetNameDef]'s aim is to "put a halt to the march of tyranny, wherever it may rear its ugly head".\n\nWhether the threat of war will serve to halt the expansionism of certain nations remains to be seen, but already recruitment programs are well on their way in [From.GetNameDef], lending credence to their statements."
