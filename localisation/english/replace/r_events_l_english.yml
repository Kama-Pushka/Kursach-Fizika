The centuries of British rule over the subcontinent have come to a surprisingly quick end as civil servants are ordered home and colonial administration is turned over to native Indians.\n\nOne of the first actions of the new Indian leadership was to announce a wide-ranging cooperation treaty with [GER.GetNameDef]. The Indian government refused to comment on allegations that this was the price they paid for German support."

It remains to be seen what effect this will have on the world at large, but at least in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], the people were celebrating this historic event."

 election.6.a: "We will work with the fascists to strengthen [Root.GetName]."
 political.9.d: "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.10.d: "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 political.11.d: "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.14.d: "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.15.d: "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.21.d: "Having been refused their referendum, almost a token attempt at seizing power legally, the fascists have used their significant public support and connections in the [Root.GetAdjective] military to attempt a coup. The [Root.GetRulingParty] government has refused their terms and claims it is going to fight to the end to preserve [Root.GetName] as we know it."
 political.26.d: "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 political.27.a: "For the future of [Root.GetName]"
 political.28.d: "The terrible civil war that has devastated our land draws to an end, and we have finally reached a political agreement. We now see eye to eye with our fellow [Root.GetAdjective]s, and together we will rebuild our great nation. The enemies that have sought to capitalize on our infighting must now face a united [Root.GetAdjective] state.\n\nThe new [Root.GetRulingIdeology] [Root.GetName] will never be divided again!"
 political.31.desc: "War has divided our country. It is time to start rebuilding now that we once more are at peace. There is a strong push for reunification among the [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] [ROOT.GetAdjective] factions."
 political.32.desc: "The time has come to re-unite the divided [ROOT.GetRulingIdeology] [ROOT.GetAdjective] that rose after the war. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] shall be whole again."
 yugoslavia.8.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] demands that we hand over full control of our country. The citizens of Yugoslavia will in essence become citizens of [From.GetNameDef] or one of their puppet states. We can chose to stand our ground here and hope that help will come, but this may very well be the only way to avoid a slaughter of the Yugoslav people."
 germany.115.d: "In accordance with the Danzig agreement, [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed to the transfer of Danzig to [GER.GetNameDef] control."
 germany.118.d: "With the war in Europe progressing apace, it is time for the inevitable victors to consider the future of Europe.\n\nWe may propose to [yalta_partner.GetNameDef] a conference on the division of [GER.GetNameDef] after the war, to delineate our spheres of influence on the continent.\n\nOur "friends" in [yalta_partner.GetNameDef] have indicated that they would be interested in such a conference. No doubt, they will want some kind of reward for their sacrifices."
 germany.126.a: "We shall join the state [From.GetName]!"

We cannot wait for the gears of the international revolution to turn for the [From.GetAdjective] people. With the revolution we have proven that we could crush the capitalist oppressors here, and we will crush the oppressors in [From.Capital.GetName] as well!'\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has abandoned all attempts at diplomatic rhetoric towards [From.GetRulingParty]-controlled [From.GetName].

Where they once slaved under the princes and dukes who claimed ownership of the soil, they are now forced to sell their labor to those who claim ownership of the factories. Their freedom to choose one master over the other can hardly be called liberty. Likewise, their freedom to elect their leaders is a false choice, as propaganda would never allow the true socialists to take power. A people so thoroughly indoctrinated can only be saved by a [Root.GetAdjective] intervention.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has polemicized against the government in [From.GetName] for a long time in party meetings, but this rhetoric is now used more frequently in public. There is little reason to believe that this conflict could be resolved peacefully."

Calling upon the people to devote themselves fanatically to the decrepit institution of the nation state, they have dressed up age-old ways of savagery in a modern costume, trying to present themselves as an alternative future to the inevitable international victory of the working class. It is only a matter of time until they strike against us or our allies. Let us strike first.'\n\nNo one has expected less than mutual contempt between us and the [From.GetAdjective], but the animosity has intensified lately. It now appears that conflict will arise sooner rather than later."
 war_justification.9.d: "'Despite our attempts to find a diplomatic solution to our conflict with [From.GetName], negotiations have once again broken down, leaving us with limited options. The authoritarian [From.GetLeader] regime has displayed the unreasonable approach to this matter typical of leaders who are not accountable to their people. Barring a complete turnaround in the policies of [From.GetAdjective] leadership, we will be left with no recourse but to fight.'\n\n[Root.GetAdjective] intervention in [From.GetName] has been a hot issue, with some politicians in the opposition claiming that [Root.GetRulingParty] has pursued a hawkish policy from the start. Whatever their original intent, a future war now suddenly seems very real and inevitable."

We can only hope that through this assertion of our military power, we can avoid further bloodshed in the future.'\n\nAlthough it is a popular theory that democracies do not go to war against other democracies, recent developments have pointed to a [Root.GetAdjective] invasion of [From.GetName] in the future. History may surprise us yet."
 war_justification.11.d: "'Without a doubt, [From.GetName] communism is one of the greatest threats to liberty and order in this era.

If we do not act now, we may well see this first domino fall too late, leaving more failed social experiments in its wake. How many more need die before we intervene?'\n\nThe threat of subversive activity undermining our democracy, fueled by [From.GetAdjective] ambitions, has become a hotly debated topic recently. While representatives in opposition have called this a Red Scare aimed at pursuing war with [From.GetName], the rhetoric of the [Root.GetRulingParty] has been highly successful so far."
 war_justification.12.d: "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [From.GetRulingParty] now holds [From.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [From.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nPeople who have long hoped to avoid a direct confrontation with [From.GetName] have now been strongly opposed by [Root.GetLeader], who argues that we in Machiavellian terms are merely postponing war to the advantage of the enemy. At this rate, we may strike the first blow after all."

Weather conditions forced the planes to divert their mission, a combination of smoke, clouds and technical difficulties being deciding factors in an event that may well change history.\n\nThe effects of the bomb were contained somewhat by the city's location in a valley, but the damage is still severe.

With the Vatican City also partially destroyed and the whereabouts of the Pope unknown, the event has horrified not only Italians, but Catholics around the world.\n\nRome's rapid growth in the past decade has been nearly completely undone by the attack.

France was in shock as its capital suffered what may be the most devastating attack it ever experienced, despite centuries of wars and revolutions. The Parisians had perhaps expected conquest, but not utter, brutal desolation.\n\nAny victory parades at Champs-elysees past the remains of the Arc de Triomphe seem unlikely in the city's current state. Perhaps the coming decades will see the birth of a new Paris, but Paris in the public mind, the city built in the Belle epoque, is gone forever."

The surrounding area of Öresund has also seen significant fallout and survivors have begun escaping to Fyn and the mainland in fear of further attacks.\n\nKing Christian X's whereabouts are currently unknown, and the nation's morale has been severely damaged by the attack. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of the end for one of Europe's oldest nations."

 nuke_dropped.13.d: "The beautiful city of Stockholm, proud Venice of the North, was struck by a nuclear bomb today. Despite their best efforts to stay neutral in the past, the Swedes have now paid the ultimate price for international conflict. The epicenter of the blast was in the middle of south central Stockholm, an area intended for future development and grand construction projects, now irreversibly destroyed.\n\nMuch of the city is beyond recognition, but the old structures at Slussen seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
