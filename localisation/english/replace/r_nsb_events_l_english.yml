 BALTIC_events.1.d: "A telegram from [From.GetNameDef] was delivered to [Root.GetLeader] this morning requesting that [Root.GetNameDef] renews her guarantees of [From.GetAdjective] independence. Citing the longstanding friendship between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef] since the state’s inception in 1918, [From.GetLeader] insists that the survival of [From.GetLeader.GetHerHis] nation is imperative to continued peace in Eastern Europe.\n\nWith tensions brewing between [From.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDefCap], accepting [From.GetLeader]’s proposal may bring [Root.GetNameDef] into conflict with the [SOV.GetAdjective]s…"
 BALTIC_events.101.d: "[From.GetLeader] has announced [From.GetHerHis] support for continued [Root.GetAdjective] independence and will join any conflicts which threaten the continued existence of [Root.GetNameDef]."
 BALTIC_events.301.d: "Our friends and allies in [From.GetNameDef] have answered [Root.GetLeader]s plea for direct intervention by refusing to enter. [From.GetLeader] claims that if the [Root.GetAdjective] workers are to be liberated, they must do so by themselves and any direct intervention on behalf of [From.GetNameDef] would be regarded as an act of imperialism."
 BALTIC_events.501.d: "Word has returned from [From.GetNameDef] in regards to the [Root.GetAdjective] request to form a united [Root.GetNonIdeologyName]-Belarus SSR. [From.GetLeader] is excited by the opportunities presented by this unification between mainland eastern europe and a Baltic nation, claiming that such a union will inevitably bridge the gaps between the East and the West, easing the ability to spread the revolution across the continent."
 BALTIC_events.6.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Seeks Baltic Unification"
 BALTIC_events.601.d: "[From.GetLeader] has responded to the [Root.GetAdjective] request to unify with outright disgust and refusal. Though many respect [From.GetNameDef]’s right to self-govern, it is irrefutable that the Baltics would fare better as a united force than a divided one."
 BALTIC_events.7.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap], the [Root.GetAdjective] gateway to Western Europe has today proposed a plan to invade [baltic_wargoal_target.GetNameDef] on behalf of [Root.GetNameDefCap]. [From.GetLeader] claims that a [baltic_wargoal_target.GetAdjective] invasion would be invaluable in our joint effort to spread the revolution across Europe and would open more opportunities for expansion once the [baltic_wargoal_target.GetAdjective] government has been dismantled."
 BALTIC_events.19.desc: "It is a great day for [ROOT.GetNameDef]! After the valiant campaign fought by our comrades, [SOV.GetNameDefCap] has rightfully declared that the newly liberated [BALTIC_country_to_transfer.GetNonIdeologyName], along with its brave workers, will fall under our jurisdiction.[GetExtraBalticTerritories]\n\nThis brings us yet another step closer to a united Baltic State powerful enough to fight off the enemies of the working class."
 BALTIC_entente_events.1.d: "As leader of the Baltic Union, [From.GetNameDef] has funded a new initiative for member-states of the union. The funding is of mutual benefit to [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef] and shows a commitment to the continued freedom and development of our nations!"
 LIT_events.1.t: "The [SOV.GetAdjective]-[LIT.GetAdjective] Partition of [POL.GetNameDef]"
 LIT_events.101.d: "Ever since 1920, Wilno has been under the control of [Root.GetNameDef], much to the constant aggravation of [LIT.GetNameDef] who sees the city as the rightful capital of their nation. Tensions, however, have reached a boiling point and with the assistance of none other than [SOV.GetLeader], the Lithuanians now demand that Eastern Poland be partitioned between the [SOV.GetAdjective]s and Lithuania. Should we accept, we will surrender the entirety of Eastern Poland, but should we refuse; we will find ourselves the prime target of a [SOV.GetAdjective]-[LIT.GetAdjective] coalition."
 LIT_events.3.d: "The point of contention between [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] and [From.GetNonIdeologyName] for the past decade has been the [Root.GetAdjective] occupation of [From.GetNonIdeologyName]’s traditional capital of Vilnius. Now that the two nations are in cordial relations, [From.GetLeader] proposes a state of perpetual peace on the condition that [Root.GetNameDef] surrenders control of Vilnius and abandons all claims to [From.GetAdjective] territory. Refusal would be a disappointment, but would not result in [From.GetNonIdeologyName] pursuing war with [Root.GetNameDef], claims [From.GetLeader]."
 LIT_events.302.d: "[From.GetLeader] has refused to acknowledge [Root.GetNameDef]’s claim to the historic [Root.GetAdjective] capital. Though this will not end peaceful relations between the two nations, it’s unquestionable that this has reignited the sense of mistrust [Root.GetNameDef] has for her former adversary."
 LIT_events.4.d: "Fearful of an invasion, the ministers of [From.GetNameDef] have offered to allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops to base themselves inside [From.GetNonIdeologyName]’s borders. In return, the [From.GetAdjective] government expects [Root.GetNameDef] to protect them from any who would threaten their sovereignty, although with troops inside their borders already, [From.GetNameDef] would be quite powerless to resist any [Root.GetAdjective] demands…"
 LIT_events.6.d: "A telegram arrived from [From.Capital.GetName] today making the proposition that [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] and [From.GetNonIdeologyName] unite into a new faction, capable of rivalling both [GER.GetNameDef] and [SOV.GetNameDef]. As nationalist states trapped between these two powers, both nations are diplomatically isolated from the major powers of Europe, and the democratic powers of the west would be reluctant to join a conflict in the defence of two fascist nations.\n\n[From.GetLeader] proposes an alternative to the years of conflict which characterized [Root.GetAdjective]-[From.GetAdjective] relations since the inception of their states. [From.GetLeader.GetSheHeCap] proposes that our nations unite into a Polish-Lithuanian Supremacy League; an alliance founded on the principals of the Commonwealth, but valuing the virtues of nationalism."
 LIT_events.9.d: "Citing the long cooperative history between Poland and Lithuania, [From.GetLeader] has suggested that the [Root.GetFactionName] occupation of Poland would be without incident if it were brought under the sole administration of [From.GetNameDef]. Doing so would mean sacrificing the valuable resources that Poland provides, but it will mean that the Polish resistance shall become a Lithuanian problem."
 LAT_events.1.d: "Though independent, [Root.GetNameDef] has never truly managed to shake off the chains of imperialism from her nation. [GER.GetAdjective]s and [SOV.GetAdjective]s alike have ambitions and designs to entrap [Root.GetNameDef] into their respective empires with little to no concern for [Root.GetNameDef]’s right to self determination. Though many are eager to fight a war on all fronts to maintain [Root.GetAdjective] independence, we must decide who among these two powers is the most pressing threat and take appropriate measures to prepare for an invasion."
 nsb_coup.3.desc: "Following weeks of planning, last night a group of officers ordered the execution [Root.GetOperationName], a plan to seize control of the government. \n\nIt appears that they had to put their plan into motion prematurely, and events quickly spiralled out of control. An attempt to arrest or kill [Root.GetLeader] failed to do either, and the net of roadblocks around the capital had not yet closed when numerous government officials made their escape.\n\nThe government of [Root.GetNameDef] lives to fight another day, and [Root.GetLeader] has pledged to bring the traitors to justice - by any means necessary."
 LAT_events.2.d: "Citing the mounting pressure in the Baltic, [From.GetLeader] has declared that Baltic unification is an absolute necessity for the continued survival of the three states. However, the demands from the foreign minister of [From.GetNameDef] would not only push [Root.GetLeader] out of office, it would essentially make the entire [Root.GetRulingParty] party entirely subservient to [From.GetLeader] and [From.GetLeader.GetHerHis] administration."
 LAT_events.7.d: "Receiving heavy support from the fascist government of [From.GetNameDef], supporters of the [Root.GetFascistParty] have gathered in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] with violent intent. The rioters eventually reached [Root.Capital.GetName]’s parliament building during a session held by [Root.GetLeader] and several key members of the [Root.GetRulingParty] Party, chanting for [Root.GetLeader]’s resignation."
 EST_events.202.d: "In spite of the overwhelming influence that the Vapsid government of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] holds over [From.GetNameDef], [From.GetLeader] has refused [Root.GetAdjective] efforts for unification."
 EST_events.4.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Seeks Baltic Unification"
 EST_events.401.d: "[From.GetLeader] has been successfully wooed by [Root.GetAdjective] efforts to instill a pan-Baltic national identity and has agreed to merge the [From.GetFascistParty] Party with the [Root.GetFascistParty]. A firm victory in [Root.GetLeader]’s goal to unite the Baltics, [Root.GetNameDef] will surely be in a much better position to defend itself from the [SOV.GetAdjective] invasion."
 EST_events.801.t: "Chaotic March in [From.GetName]"
 EST_events.801.d: "The [Root.GetFascistParty] demonstration in [From.GetName] was met with a mixed response from the public and a violent backlash from local authorities. Few among the crowd were even able to tell what the march was about, with violence between protestors and counter-protestors taking center-stage in the demonstration. The [Root.GetAdjective] government are already working towards stomping out the [Root.GetFascistParty], and today’s events has likely hastened that process while doing little to win over the crowd."
 EST_events.802.t: "The March in [From.GetName]"
 EST_events.802.d: "The [Root.GetFascistParty] march across [From.GetName] went by relatively without incident. Avoiding major population centers and instead focussing on more rural areas of [From.GetName], the [Root.GetFascistParty] were able to show the people of [Root.GetName] what the movement stands for while avoiding retribution from [Root.GetAdjective] officials."
 EST_events.803.t: "Overwhelming Fascist March in [From.GetName]"
 EST_events.803.d: "All across the state of [From.GetName], [Root.GetFascistParty] demonstrators came out in droves to show their support for a strong nationalistic state. Though officials attempted to prevent the demonstrators from marching upon major population centers, these officers laid down their arms and allowed the [Root.GetFascistParty] men to march peacefully through the streets. Without any major counter-protestors to contend with, this was a resounding victory for the [Root.GetFascistParty] movement."
 EST_events.901.t: "[From.GetLeader] Steps Down"
 EST_events.901.d: "Surprisingly, when [FROM.GetFascistParty] forces advanced on the [From.GetAdjective] capital today, rather than igniting a civil war as expected, the former [From.GetAdjective] government declared that it would surrender its power and abdicate to the authority of the [FROM.GetFascistParty] party."
 NSB_poland_events.1.desc: "Citing the apparent lack in defensive capabilities of [Root.GetNameDef], officials from [From.GetNameDef] have demanded that the entire Slovakia region come under direct Polish occupation. They demand in no uncertain terms that if we do not submit, invasion is inevitable. How should we respond?"
 NSB_poland_events.202.desc: "Leaders of the [From.GetAdjective] government have announced that they will not acknowledge [Root.GetLeader]’s claim to the [From.GetAdjective] throne. Although this ends the possibility for any peaceful annexation of [From.GetNameDef], it does mean that the claim may still be pushed through war."
 NSB_poland_events.3.desc: "Officials from [From.GetNameDef] have announced interest in signing an alliance with the new German Empire. Believing Kaiser [Root.GetLeader] to be more amicable to [From.GetAdjective] independence than [Root.GetHerHis] predecessor, and citing that [From.GetNameDef]’s modern incarnation can be directly attributed to the Act of the 5th of November signed by the Central Powers, [From.GetNameDef] proposes that the two states sign a formal alliance.\nAccepting would mark a monumental anomaly in the history of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName]-[From.GetNonIdeologyName] relations and mark a potential bright future for the two nations."
 NSB_poland_events.4.desc: "The Polish Maritime and Colonial League has today approached the [Root.GetAdjective] ambassador in [From.Capital.GetName] with an offer to purchase the overseas territory of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName]. Exchanging [POL_colony_purchase.GetName] with the Poles would certainly provide a sizable budget surplus for [Root.GetNameDef] but would however make [From.GetNameDef] sovereign over all of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName] and her precious raw resources and civil population."
 NSB_poland_events.401.a: "Welcome, people of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName]"
 NSB_poland_events.401.desc.com: "[From.GetNameDefCap] returned to us today and agreed to sell the overseas territory of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName]. All that remains now is to settle our debts to [From.GetNameDef], but already the people of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName] have been liberated from the clutches of [From.GetAdjective] colonialism."
 NSB_poland_events.401.desc.dem: "[From.GetNameDefCap] returned to us today and agreed to sell the overseas territory of [POL_colony_purchase.GetName]. Although we are now in debt to [From.GetNameDef], this sale could not have come in a time of more dire need for [Root.GetNameDef]. With [POL_colony_purchase.GetName] now under our direct control, we have been given another stronghold where our government may continue to exist in exile."
 NSB_poland_events.701.desc: "The [From.GetNameDef] government has refused to sign a formal alliance with us at this time. This bitter diplomatic defeat leaves the Front Morges’ plan for a Franco-Polish alliance as a thing of mere fantasy, and we must instead look to others for support."
 NSB_poland_monarchist_events.3.desc: "[From.GetLeader] has today been coronated as the new King of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName]. A long series of propaganda campaigns has turned many [Root.GetAdjective] ministers against the old regime and caused a bloodless coup. This coup has rendered [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] little more than [From.GetNameDef]’s puppet, and the future looks bleak for future [Root.GetAdjective] autonomy."
 NSB_poland_monarchist_events.4.desc: "The streets of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] have been set ablaze today as pro and anti monarchist militia have plunged the nation into civil war! Supporters of [Root.GetLeader] and [From.GetLeader] are engaged in skirmishes all across the nation, and ministers from [From.GetNameDef] are refusing to acknowledge their involvement in this impeachment of our national sovereignty. Little is left now than to wait and see which side of this conflict emerges victorious."
 NSB_poland_royal_election.3.t: "Prussian Prince"
 NSB_poland_royal_election.3.desc: "Today an unusual candidate appeared at the Board of Regents. August Wilhelm is a member of the German monarchical house of Hohenzollern, who was once considered to be king of Poland in 1918, but failed after the German troops withdrew from Warsaw. August has many plans for the future of the country, but the main one is to avenge defeat in the Great War and restore the monarchies in the Baltics and Germany."

He was also nominated for this role at the end of the Great War, and since he abdicated the Bulgarian throne, he can still take our throne. The choice of Kiril will strengthen Slavic solidarity and allow the realization of many pan-Slavic ideas which Kiril, among others, is nurturing."

 NSB_poland_communist_events.2.desc: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has offered to grant us total military protection in exchange for overlordship of [Root.GetNonIdeologyName]. Citing the immediate and lifelong existential threat that Russia and Germany have posed to [Root.GetNonIdeologyName], politicians from [From.GetNameDef] offer us a protectorate position. Accepting would make [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] a puppet, but it doesn’t sound like [From.GetNonIdeologyName] will take no for an answer."

Through a war of propaganda and posturing, [From.GetNameDef] will attempt to weaponize opposition to [Root.GetLeader]’s regime and support an internal coup.\nShould this propaganda prove effective, [Root.GetLeader] may face a coup and [Root.GetNonIdeologyName] will be reduced to little more than a [From.GetAdjective] puppet."
