 lar_congress_of_paris.3.desc: "The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to the proposed territorial changes in principle. While there are still a few minor details to work out and the exact location of the proposed new border still remains subject of some debate, our diplomats expect no major issues that could derail the agreement."
 lar_congress_of_paris.4.desc: "The delegation from [From.GetNameDef] has declared the negotiations over. Citing a fundamental difference of opinion about the proposed changes, they have left Paris to return to [From.GetNameDef].\n\n Following their hasty departure, the [From.GetAdjective] ambassador declared that the [From.GetAdjective] government does not consider itself bound by any treaty of mutual assistance or alliance with us any further."
 lar_end_the_occupation.3.desc: "Despite the generous offer to stand side by side against the Bolshevist threat and to pursue the war-mongers that started this war, [From.GetLeader] has rudely rebuffed our diplomatic advance. The French people, he declared, had failed to show any kind of martial prowess in the war thus far and he saw no reason to entrust the defense of [From.GetNameDef]'s western borders to a country that had already been defeated once."

 lar_spain.1.desc: "Despite a massive election campaign by the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights, it is the left-wing Popular Front formed by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and Republican Left, with the aid of Anarchists, Communists, and Trade Unionists, which appears to have won the 1936 elections. Illustrating the heavily divided Spanish political landscape, the Popular Front's lead in the popular vote seems to be far more narrow than the comfortable lead in seats would indicate.\n\nWhichever new government will be formed under the leadership of President [Root.GetLeader] in the days and weeks ahead, it will have to deal with an increasingly alienated and hostile political Right. Rather than solve the political violence and societal unrest that grips our country, it therefore seems likely that the recent election's results will only serve to exacerbate it."

 lar_spain.52.desc: "Shipments from [From.GetNameDef] have begun to arrive in our country, as the [From.GetAdjective] government is moving their gold reserves abroad for safekeeping for the duration of the civil war."
 lar_spain.53.desc: "It has been some time since the [From.GetAdjective] gold reserves arrived in our country, and we have continued to send ample aid to [From.GetNameDef], without payment. Members of the government are beginning to comment on the farcical state of these affairs."
 lar_spain.53.b: "A [SPD.GetAdjective] victory would be payment enough."
 lar_spain.62.desc: "Incessant [From.GetAdjective] meddling and underground cells obtaining illicit support from [From.GetNameDef] have in recent months emboldened the local Communist groups we have struggled with for years. Undoubtedly promised more foreign aid, these groups have now taken up arms, and are joined by disloyal elements in the military in a large-scale uprising, aiming to take control of the government by force."
 lar_spain.71.a: "Compared to the elimination of [SOV.GetNameDef] everything else comes second."
