sia.44.t:0 "Restoring the absolute sovereignty of our nation"
sia.44.d:0 "Despite international recognition of our country's independence and its membership in the League of Nations, Siam still does not enjoy absolute sovereignty. For more than eighty years, since the reign of King Mongkut in 1856, the kingdom has undergone a bitter experience of unjust relations with foreign powers that have imposed legal and economic restrictions on our sovereignty under unequal treaties.\n\n It was this bitter feeling that, in part, inspired the Siamese revolution of 1932 across the population, and especially among the founders of the People's Party. It was also one of the main goals that the People's Party government intended to fulfill, and the time had come to finally achieve it!\n\n For this purpose, a new foreign ministry should be established. It will be headed by Pridi Banomyong, who had already established contacts with various governments during his trip to Europe, the United States, and Japan in the autumn of 1935. He met with Mussolini, Pierre Laval, Hjalmar Schacht, Samuel Hoare, Cordell Hull, and others, and the results were very promising."

SIA_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "In 1932, the People's Party, led by army officers, staged a coup and, with the help of Pridi Banomyong, established a constitutional monarchy in the country, which the king was forced to support under pressure. However, an attempted royalist uprising forced him to abdicate the throne in favor of a minor member of the dynasty, which strengthened the party's position in the end.\nDespite this, the party is still not unified, being divided into the navy, army, and civilian wings of the party. These wings have different opinions on the topical issues, and the approaching next crisis only adds fuel to the fire."

SIA_elections_categories:0 "Elections to the House of Representatives"
SIA_elections_categories_desc:0 "With recent events, it became clear that the incumbent Prime Minister would not be able to hold on to his position for much longer. Within the People's Party, several candidates stood out and began to compete to get their people into the House of Representatives: Pridi Banomyong, a supporter of Republican views with a strong emphasis on socialist politics. Khuang Aphaiwong, a member of the "Constitutional Front," the liberal-conservative wing of the People's Party, supports the king's positions and opposes Pridi's revolutionary reforms. Phraya Songsuradet is one of the leaders of the revolution, who has withdrawn from politics in recent years, but who still has enormous credibility within the party and enjoys absolute support among the grassroots of the army. Plaek Phibunsongkhram, a leader from the army elite who has been gaining strength in political circles lately, is the one who can become the new leader to protect the country in view of the unstable external situation.\n §YPhibunsongkhram will win by bypassing the vote if you have a national spirit "Absolute Army Influence".§!\n §GIf Phraya Songsuradet has returned to politics beforehand, it will greatly increase his starting number of supporters in the election.§!\n §PIf Pridi's supporters win and he comes to power, this could cause resentment from the pro-monarchist members of the Popular Party.§!\n §RIf a civil war breaks out because of disagreement within the party, the communists who gained strength could become a third party to the conflict.§!"
